# Truthiness

## Question #1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = "I am truthy"

if a  
	puts "Yes you are!"
else  
	puts "Nope, you are not"
end
```

The code returns `nil` and outputs the string value `Yes you are!`.

On line 1, the variable `a` is initialized and references the String object with value `I am truthy`. On line 3 there is a conditional statement `if` that evaluates the variable `a` in a boolean context. As variable `a` is truthy, the first branch of the conditional is executed, so the String object with value `Yes you are!` is passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation.

The output is the String value `Yes you are!`.

This code sniped demonstrates the concept of Truthiness, as any expression evaluated in a boolean context, will evaluate either as `true` (truthy) or `false` (falsy). **In Ruby, all values are considered truthy except for `false` and `nil`.**

## Question #2

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def valid_user?  
	true
end

user_valid = valid_user?

if user_valid  
	puts "Welcome to our Program!"
else  
	puts "Invalid credentials!"
end
```

The code returns `nil` and outputs the String `Welcome to our Program˜

On line 5, the variable `user_valid` is initialized and references the return value of the `valid_user?` method invocation. 

On line 1-3, the `valid_user?` method is defined and returns the boolean `true`.

On line 7, there is an `if` conditional statement that evaluates the truthiness of the `user_valid` variable. As the variable `user_valid` is truthy, the String object with value `Welcome to our Program!` is passed as an argument to the `puts` method, outputting the string to the console.

This code sniped demonstrates the concept of Truthiness as any expression evaluated in a boolean context, will evaluate either as `true` (truthy) or `false` (falsy).

**Feedback:**

To improve the precision, you could mention that the `puts` method is responsible for both outputting the string and returning `nil`. Also, you could clarify that the `if` statement itself doesn't return anything in this case; it's the `puts` method that returns `nil`.
