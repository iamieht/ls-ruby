# Local Variable Scope

## Question #1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = "Hello"
b = a
a = "Goodbye"

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code snippet returns `nil` and outputs `Goodbye` and `Hello`

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references a string object with value `Hello`.

on line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized and references the same object as `a`.

On line 3, `a` is reassigned to the string object with value `Goodbye`.

On line 5, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `Goodbye`.

On line 6, we call the `puts` method with `b` as an argument, outputting `Hello`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variable as pointers to objects in memory. Reassigning `a` has no effect on `b`, which indicates that variables are not deeply linked to each other. 


## Question # 2

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4

loop do
	a = 5
	b = 3
	break
end

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code returns `nil`, outputs `5` and raises a `NameError` exception.

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references an Integer object with value `4`.

On lines 3-7, we have a `loop` method invocation that gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. 

Within the block, `a` is reassigned to `5` and `b` is initialized and references an integer object with value `3`. On the next line, a `break` statements takes us out of the loop.

On line 9, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `5` and returning `nil`.

On line 10, we call the `puts` method with `b` as an argument, raising a `NameError` exception as `b` is not accessible in the outer scope as it was initialized in an inner scope (inside the block).

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation, in which variables initialized inside the block are not accessible outside the block.


## Question #3

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4
b = 2

loop do  
  c = 3  
  a = c  
  break
end

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code returns `nil` and outputs `3` and `2` on separate lines.

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references an Integer object with value `4`.

On line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized and references `2`.

On lines 4-8, the `loop` method is invoked and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. Within the block, `c` is initialized to `3`, `a` is reassigned to the same value as `c`, which is `3`, and `break` statement stops the loop execution.

On line 10, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `3` and retuning `nil`.

On line 11, we call the `puts` method with `b` as an argument, outputting `2` and returning `nil`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation, as well as variable as pointers.


## Question #4

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def example(str)
  i = 3  
  loop do    
    puts str    
    i -= 1    
    break if i == 0  
  end
end

example('hello')
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `hello` and returns `nil`.

On line 10, we call the `example` method with the string `hello` as an argument.

On lines 1-8, we define the `example` method with a parameter `str`. `hello` is bound to the method parameter `str`.

On line 2, the method local variable `i` is initialized and references an Integer object with value `3`

On lines 3-7, the `loop` method is invoked and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. Within the block, on line 4, we call the `puts`method with `str` as an argument, outputting `hello`. On line 5, `i` is decreased by `1` and on line 6, the expression `if i == 0`  is evaluated and once the value of `i` is 0, the `loop` execution is stopped, which happens after 3 iterations, so the string `hello` is outputted 3 times.

The code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as pass-by-value as the object passed into the method is not mutated. Also it demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation.

## Question #5

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
def greetings(str)  
  puts str  
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"
greetings(word)
```

**Answer**

This code returns `nil` and outputs `Hello` and `Goodbye` on separate lines.

On line 6, the local variable `word` is initialized and references a string object with value `Hello`.

On line 7, we call the `greetings` method with the value referenced by `word` as an argument.

On lines 1-4, the `greetings` method is defined. The value `Hello`is bound to the method parameter `str`.

On line 2, we call the `puts` method with `str` as an argument, outputting `Hello`.

On line 3, we call the `puts` method with the string object `Goodbye` as an argument, outputting it.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as pass-by-value as the object passed into the method is not mutated.

## Question #6

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
counter = 0
sum = 0

loop do  
  sum += arr[counter]  
  counter += 1  
  break if counter == arr.size
end 

puts "Your total is #{sum}"
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `Your total is 10` and returns `nil`

On line 1, the local variable `arr` is initialized and references an array object with the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

On line 2, the local variable `counter` is initialized and references `0`

On line 3, the local variable `sum` is initialized and references `0`.

On lines 5-9, the `loop` method is invoked and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. Within the block, the method `+` is called on the object referenced by `sum` and gets passed the element referenced by `arr[counter]` in each iteration as an argument. The returned value is reassigned to `sum`. 

On line 7, the method `+` is called on the object referenced by `counter` and gets passed `1` as argument, incrementing the value of `counter`in `1`. On line 8, the expression `counter == arr.size` is evaluated and if returns `true` the `loop` execution is stopped and we break out of it. 

After 4 iterations (number of elements in the array), `sum` references the value `10` as the sum of each element of the array returns `10`.

On Line 11, we call the `puts` method with the string `Your total is #{sum}` in which the variable `sum` is interpolated, outputting `Your total is 10`.

This code snippets demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation.

=======================================================================
**Second try**

This code outputs `Your total is 10` and returns `nil`

On line 1, the local variable `arr` is initialized and references an array object with 4 Integer objects `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

On line 2, the local variable `counter` is initialized and references `0`

On line 3, the local variable `sum` is initialized and references `0`.

On line 5, we call the `loop` method and passed a `do..end` block as an argument. On line 6, we call the `+` method on the object referenced by `sum`and passed the returned value of the expression `arr[counter]`, which is `1`. The returned value is reassigned to `sum` referencing now the Integer object `1`. 

On line 7, we call the `+` method on the object referenced by `counter` and passed `1` as an argument, reassigning the returned value `1` to counter.

On line 8, the `break` statement is called once the `counter` is equal to the size of the array, stopping the `loop` execution and breaking out of it.

As the array has 4 elements, the `loop` will be executed 4 times and each element of the array will be added to `sum` resulting in `10` at the end of the iterations.

On Line 11, we call the `puts` method with the string `Your total is #{sum}` in which the variable `sum` is interpolated, outputting `Your total is 10`.

This code snippets demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation.

## Question #7

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 'Bob'

5.times do |x|  
  a = 'Bill'
end

p a
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `Bill`

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references a string object with value `Bob`

On lines 3-5, the `times` method is invoked on `5` and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument.

The block parameter `x` is bound to the values yield by the  `times`method, starting from `0` up to `4`. Within the block `a` is reassigned to `Bill` during each iteration.

On line 7, we call the `p`method with `a` as an argument, returning `"Bill"`and outputting `Bill`

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after a method invocation.

## Question #8

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
animal = "dog"

loop do |_|  
  animal = "cat"  
  var = "ball"  
  break
end

puts animal
puts var
```

**Answer**

This code returns `nil`, outputs `cat` and raises a `NameError` exception.

On line 1, the local variable `animal`is initialized and references a string object with value `dog`

On line 3, we call the `loop` method and we passed a `do..end` block as an argument.

Within the block, on line 4, we reassigned `animal` to `cat`. On line 5, we initialized a local variable `var`in the inner scope and references the string object with value `ball`. On line 6, a `break` statement stops and exits the `loop`execution.

On line 9, we call the `puts` method with `animal` as an argument, outputting `cat`

On line 10, we call the `puts` method with `var` as an argument, raising a `NameError` exception as `var` is not accessible in the outer scope as it was initialized within the block.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope in relation to blocks after method invocation, in which variables initialized in the outer scope are accessible inside the block, but not vice versa.

## Question #9

What will be the output of this code?

```ruby
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

name = "Alice"
greet("Bob")
puts name
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `Hello Bob!` and `Alice` on a separate line.

On line 5, we initialized the local variable `name`, which references a string object with value `Alice`.

On line 6, we call the `greet` method with the string `Bob` as an argument. `Bob` is then bound to the method parameter `name`. Within the method definition, we call the `puts` method with the string object `Hello, #{name}` as an argument, interpolating the method local variable `name`into the string, outputting `Hello, Bob!`.

On line 7, we call the `puts` method with `name` as an argument, outputting `Alice`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as if pass-by-value, as the passed in object is not mutated.

## Question #10

What will this code print?

```ruby
x = 10

def change_x(x)
  x = 20
end

change_x(x)
puts x
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `10`

On line 1, the local variable `x` is initialized and referenced an Integer object with value `10`

On line 7, we call the `change_x` method with the value referenced by `x` as an argument. `10`is then bound to the method parameter `x`.

Inside the method, the method local variable `x` is reassigned to `20` and implicitly returned. As the returned value is not used outside the method, it is discarded.

On line 8, we call the `puts` method with `x` as an argument, outputting `10`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as if pass-by-value, as the passed in object is immutable, so the object reference by local variable `x` and method local variable `x` are different objects.
