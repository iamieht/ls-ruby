# Variable Shadowing

## Question #1

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
animal = "dog"

loop do |_|  
  animal = "cat"  
  var = "ball"  
  break
end

puts animal
puts var
```

## Question #2

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
a = 4 
b = 22.times do |a|  
	a = 5  
	puts a
end
puts a
puts b
```

## Question #3

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
n = 101.times do |n|  
	n = 11
end
puts n
```

## Question #4

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
animal = "dog"

loop do |animal|  
	animal = "cat"  
	break
end
puts animal
```

## Question #5

What will be the output of the following code?

```ruby
a = 4
[1, 2, 3].each do |a|
  puts a
end
puts a
```


## Question #6

Explain the difference in output between these two code snippets:

```ruby
# Snippet 1
x = 10
[1, 2, 3].each do |x|
  puts x * 2
end
puts x

# Snippet 2
x = 10
[1, 2, 3].each do |y|
  puts x * 2
end
puts x
```


### Question #7

What will this code output and why?

```ruby
name = "global"
["local"].each do |name|
  puts name
  name = "block"
  puts name
end
puts name
```


## Question #8

Identify the variable shadowing in this code and explain its effects:

```ruby
total = 0
[1, 2, 3].each do |total|
  total += 10
  puts total
end
puts total
```


## Question #9

How would you modify this code to avoid variable shadowing while achieving the same result?

```ruby
sum = 0
[1, 2, 3].each do |sum|
  sum += 1
  puts sum
end
puts sum
```
