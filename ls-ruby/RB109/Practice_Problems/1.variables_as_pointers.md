# Object Passing/Variables as Pointers

## ==Question # 1==

Explain the concept of "Variables as Pointers". As part of your explanation, include a code snippet that accurately demonstrates this concept, and explain the effect it has within that example.

**Answer**

Variables don't contain values, they contain pointers to a physical space in memory, that store values. Variables are not deeply linked to each other.

```ruby
name = "Ivan"
my_name = name
name = "María"

puts name
puts my_name
```

On line 1, we initialized the variable `name` to reference the string object with value `"Ivan"`. On line 2, we initialized the variable `my_name` to reference the same object as variable `name`. On line 3, we reassign the variable `name` to the string object `"María"`.

On line 5, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the object referenced by variable `name` as an argument. As variable `name` references the string object with value `"María"`, this is output into the console. 

On line 6, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the object referenced by variable `my_name` as an argument, outputting the value `"Ivan"` to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers.


## ==Question # 2==

What is the output of this code? Why? 

```ruby
a = "hi there"
b = a
a = "not here"

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `not here` and `hi there`.

On line 1, the variable `a` is initialized and references the string object with value `"hi there"`. 

On line 2, the variable `b` is initialized and references the same string object as `a`. 

On line 3, `a` is reassigned and references the string object with value `"not here"`.

On line 5, the `puts` method is called with `a` as an argument, outputting the string `not here` to the console. 

On line 6, the `puts` method is called with `b` as an argument, outputting the string `"hi there"` to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers to objects in memory, and how reassignment of a variable does not affect other variables that were previously pointing to the same object.

## ==Question # 3==

What is the output of this code? Why? 

```ruby
a = "hi there"
b = a
a << ", Bob"

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code outputs

```
hi there, Bob
hi there, Bob
```

On line 1, the variable `a` is initialized and references the string object with value `"hi there"`. 

On line 2, the variable `b` is initialized and references the same string object as `a`. 

On line 3, the method `#<<` is invoked on the string object referenced by `a` , passing the string object with value `", Bob"` as an argument. This is a mutating method, so the object referenced by variable `a` and `b` are modified with the value `"hi there, Bob"`.

On line 5, the `puts` method is called with `a` as an argument, outputting the string `"hi there, Bob"`.

On line 6, the `puts` method is called with `b` as an argument, outputting the string `"hi there, Bob"`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers to objects in memory as well as object mutation and how different variables pointing to the same object in memory are affected by the mutation of that object.

## ==Question # 4==

What is the output of this code? Why? 

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 3]
b = a
c = a.uniq

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code outputs:

```
1
2
3
3
1
2
3
3
```

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references an Array object with value `[1, 2, 3, 3]`. 

On line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized and references the same array object as `a`. 

On line 3, the local variable `c` is initialized and references the return value of calling the `Array#uniq` method on the object referenced by `a`. The `Array#uniq` method returns a new Array object with duplicates values removed, so  `c` is assigned to a new Array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`. This operation does not modify the object referenced by `a` and `b`.

On line 5, the `puts` method is called with `a` as an argument. This outputs each element of the array on a separate line:  `1, 2, 3, 3`.

On line 6, the `puts` method is called with `b` as an argument. This also outputs `1, 2, 3, 3`, on separate lines, as  `a` and `b` reference the same Array object.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers to objects in memory, and how non-mutating method calls (like `Array#uniq`) do not affect the original object or other variables referencing that object.


## ==Question # 5==

Are `a` and `b` referencing the same object? Why? What is `a`? What if we called `map!` instead of `map`?

```ruby
def test(b)
  b.map { |letter| "I like the letter: #{letter}" }
end

a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
test(a)
```

Yes, `a` and `b` are referencing the same object.

On line 4, local variable `a` is initialized and references the Array Object with value `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

On line 5, the `test` method is invoked and gets passed the object referenced by local variable `a` as an argument, which is then bound to the parameter `b` of the `test` method. At this point both local variable `a` and method local variable `b` are referencing the same object in memory.

From lines 1-3, the `test` method is defined with a single parameter `b`. Within the method's body, the `Array#map` method is invoked on the object referenced by `b`and gets passed a block as an argument. Within the block, with each iteration, the block parameter `letter` is assigned the value of each element of the array object and the string object with value `"I like the letter: #{letter}"` is returned, interpolating the value of the variable `letter` within the string object. A new array object is returned by the `Array#map` method invocation, as it is not a destructive method, so after each iteration, a new array with the values `["I like the letter: a", "I like the letter: b", "I like the letter: c"]`is returned by the method as is the only line evaluated.

As the returned value from the method is not stored anywhere, the value is lost, so `a` still references the same Array object  with value `["a", "b", "c"]`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing, in which Ruby behaves as "pass-by-value" as the original object is not mutated.

In case we called the method `map!` the original object will be mutated in place and now the variable `a` will reference the value `["I like the letter: a", "I like the letter: b", "I like the letter: c"]`. In this case the object passing strategy behaves like "pass-by-reference" as the original object is mutated.

## ==Question # 6==

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
a = 5.2
b = 7.3
a = b
b += 1.1

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `7.3` and `8.4`

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references the Float Object with value `5.2`. 

On line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized and references the Float Object with value `7.3`. 

On line 3, the variable `a` is reassigned and references the same object as  `b`.

On line 4, the operator `#+=` is invoked on the object referenced by `b` and gets passed `1.1` as an argument. The return value `8.4` is then reassigned to the variable `b`. As we are working with immutable objects, the return values of any method invocation will result in a new object being created.

On line 6, the `puts` method is called with `a` as an argument. This outputs `7.3`.

On line 7, the `puts`method is called with `b` as an argument. This outputs `8.4`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers to objects in memory, and how reassignment of a variable does not affect other variables that were previously pointing to the same object.

## ==Question # 7==

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
def test(str)
  str  += '!'
  str.downcase!
end

test_str = 'Written Assessment'
test(test_str)

puts test_str
```

**Answer**

The output is the string `Written Assessment`.

On line 6, the local variable `test_str` is initialized and references the string object with value `Written Assessment`.

On line 7, the `test` method is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by `test_str` as an argument. The value is then bound to the method parameter `str`.

Within the method's body, the operator `#+=` is used on the String Object referenced by method local variable `str`,  and gets passed the string object with value `!` as an argument, creating a new String Object with the value `Written Assessment!` and reassigning it to `str`. On line 3, the `downcase!` method is invoked on this new String object, mutating it to `written assessment!`. This mutated string is the implicit return value of the method.

As the return value of the `test` method invocation is not assigned to any variable, it is discarded.

On line 9, the `puts` method is called with `test_str` as an argument. This outputs `Written Assessment`.

This code snippet demonstrates that Ruby behaves as Pass-by-value as the object passed into the method is not mutated, so the original object remains unchanged.



## ==Question # 8== 

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
def plus(x, y)
  x = x + y
end

a = 3
b = plus(a, 2)

puts a
puts b
```

**Answer**

The output is `3` and `5`.

On line 5, the local variable `a` is initialized and references the integer object with value `3`.

On line 6, the local variable `b` is initialized to the return value of the `plus` method invocation. The `plus` method is called with `a` and `2` as arguments.

From lines 1-3, the method `plus` is defined and the parameters `x` and `y` are bound to the object with values `3`and `2` respectively. 

Within the method's body, the result of `x + y` (which is `5`) is reassigned to the method local variable `x`, which is then implicitly returned by the method, as it is the last line evaluated.

The returned value `5` is assigned to the local variable `b` on line 6.

On line 8, the `puts` method is called with `a` as an argument. This outputs `3`.

On line 9, the `puts` method is called with `b` as an argument. This outputs `5`.

This code snippet demonstrates that Ruby behaves as Pass-by-value for immutable objects like Integers. The original Integer object referenced by `a` remains unchanged, while the method creates and returns a new Integer object.


## ==Question # 9==

What do you think the output of this code will be when we call `puts y` at the end? And can you explain why?

```ruby
def increment(x)
  x << 'b'
end

y = 'a'

increment(y)
puts y
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is `ab`.

On line 5, the local variable `y` is initialized and references the string object with value `a`.

On line 7, the `increment` method is called with `y` as an argument. The String object referenced by `y` is then bound to the method parameter `x`.

From lines 1-3 the method `increment` is defined. Within the method's body, the method `#<<` is called on the object referenced by method local variable `x` with the string object `b` as an argument, concatenating the string `b` to it. This operation mutates the original String object to `ab`. As this is the last line evaluated in the method, the mutated string is implicitly returned.

On line 8, the `puts` method is called with `y` as an argument, outputting `ab`.

This code snippet demonstrates object passing in which Ruby behaves as "pass-by-reference", as the original object passed into the method is mutated, being an example of a method with side effects.


This question relates to concepts covered in the RB101 course, specifically dealing with object mutability, method side effects, and how Ruby handles string objects when passed to methods.


## ==Question # 10== 

Does this reassignment `name = 'bob'` change the object outside the method?

```ruby
def change_name(name) 
   name = 'bob'      
end

name = 'jim'
change_name(name)

puts name
```

**Answer**

No, this reassignment inside the `change_name` method does not change the object outside the method.

The output of this code is `jim`.

The local variable `name` is assigned to the string `jim` in the outer scope.

When `change_name` method is called, a new method local variable `name` is created within the method's scope and assigned to the value `bob`. 

This assignment only affects the method local variable `name`. It doesn't change the `name` variable in the outer scope.

After the method call, the outer `name` variable still refers to the original string `jim`.

This code snippet demonstrates object passing, in which Ruby behaves as "pass-by-value" as the reassignment operation within the method does not affect the variable outside the method.



## ==Question # 11==

Does `str.capitalize!` affect the object outside the method?

```ruby
def cap(str) 
    str.capitalize!   # 
end

name = "jim"
cap(name)
puts name
```

**Answer**

Yes it does.

On line 5, local variable `name` is initialized and references the string object with value `jim`.

On line 6, the `cap` method is called with `name` as an argument. The string `jim` is bound to the method parameter `str` and within the method's body, the mutating method `capitalize!` is called on the string referenced by `str` . This changes the value of the object to `Jim`.  Since `name` and `str` reference the same object, this change affects the object referenced by `name` in the outer scope.

On line 7, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the value `Jim` referenced by local variable `name`, as an argument, outputting `Jim`to the console.

This code snippet demonstrated object passing, in which Ruby behaves as is "Pass-by-reference", as the original string referenced by `name` is mutated within the method.



## ==Question # 12==

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
a = [1, 3]
b = [2]
arr = [a, b]
arr[1] = 5

p arr
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `[[1, 3] 5]` 

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references the Array object with value `[1, 3]`.

On line 2, local variable `b` is initialized and references the Array object with value `[2]`.

On line 3, the local variable `arr` is initialized and references a new Array object containing the objects referenced by `a` and `b`. At this point, `arr` is `[[1, 3] 5]`.

On line 4, the element at index 1 of `arr` is reassigned to the Integer `5`. This replaces the second element of the Array `[2]` with `5`.

On line 6, the `p` method is invoked and gets passed the object referenced by `arr` returning and outputting `[[1, 3], 5]` to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates mutation on Array objects and variables as pointers.



## ==Question # 13== 

What will be the values of `arr1` and `arr2` after this code is executed? Can you explain why?

```ruby
arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
arr2 = arr1.dup

arr2.map! do |char| 
    char.upcase
end

puts arr1
puts arr2
```

**Answer**

The value of `arr1` is `["a", "b", "c"]` and the value of `arr2` is `["A", "B". "C"]`

On line 1, local variable `arr1` is initialized and references the array object with value `["a", "b", "c"]`.

On line 2, local variable `arr2` is initialized and references the return value of the `dup` method invocation on `arr1`. `arr2` references a new array object that contains the same values as `arr1`.

On line 4, the `map!` method is invoked on the Array object referenced by `arr2` and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. For each element of the array, the block is executed with the element assigned to the block parameter `char`. The `upcase` method is called on `char`, returning an uppercased version of the string. The `map!` method replaces each element of `arr2` with the return value of the block.

On line 8, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by `arr1`, outputting each element on a separate line: `a b c` .

On line 9, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by `arr2`, outputting each element on a separate line: `A B C`.

This code snippet demonstrates mutability and method invocation with blocks.



## Question #14

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b << 4
puts a.inspect
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

On line 1, local variable `a` is initialized and references array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`

On line 2, local variable `b` is initialized and references the same object as `a`

On line 3, method `#<<`is invoked on the value referenced by `b` and gets passed `4` as an argument, appending the value `4` to the object referenced by both `a` and `b` , mutating the object.

On line 4, the `inspect`method is invoked on the object referenced by `a` returning the value `[1, 2, 3, 4]` that gets passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, outputting the value to the console.

This code snippet demonstrates variables as pointers and object mutability.


## Question #15

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
def modify_array(arr)
  arr.pop
end

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
modify_array(numbers)
puts numbers.inspect
```

**Answer**

This code outputs `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

On line 5, local variable `numbers` is initialized and references an array object with value `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

On line 6, the method `modify_aray` is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by local variable `numbers` as an argument.

On lines 1-3, the method `modify_array`is defined and the method parameter `arr` is bound to the value referenced by local variable `numbers`. Within the method's body, the `pop` method is invoked on the object referenced by method local variable `arr`, removing and returning the last element of the array, in this case `5`.

On line 7, the `inspect` method is invoked on the object referenced by `numbers` and its return value `[1, 2, 3, 4]` gets passed to the `puts` method invocation as an argument, outputting it to the console.

## Question #16

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
x = "hello"
y = x
x.upcase!
puts y
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is the string `HELLO`.

On line 1, variable `x` is initialized and references the string object with value `hello`.

On line 2, the variable `y` is initialized and references the same object as `x`.

On line 3, the method `upcase!` is invoked on the object referenced by the variable `x` mutating the object, which now has the value `HELLO`.

On line 4, method `puts` is invoked and gets passed the object referenced by variable `y`, outputting `HELLO` to the console.

This code demonstrates the concept of variable as pointers and mutability.
## Question #17

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
def change_string(str)
  str.replace("new string")
end

original = "old string"
change_string(original)
puts original
```

The output of this code is the string `new string`.

On line 5, local variable `original` is initialized and references the string object with value `old string`.

On line 6, the method `change_string` is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by `original`, which is bound to the method parameter `str`.

On line 2, the method `replace` is invoked on the object referenced by method local variable `str` and gets passed the string object with value `new string`. The `replace` method mutates the caller, so the object referenced by `original` and by `str` has now the value `new string`. As this is the only line of the method, there is an implicit return value happening here.

On line 7, the `puts` method is invoked and gets passed the value referenced by local variable `original`, outputting `new string` to the console.

This code demonstrates object passing, in which Ruby behaves as pass-by-reference, as the original object passed into the method is mutated, affecting the original object.


## Question #18

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
a = [4, 5, 6]
puts b.inspect
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is the array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references the array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`.

On line 2, the local variable `b` is initialized and references the same object as `a`.

On line 3, `a` is reassigned to the array object `[4, 5, 6]`.

On line 4, method `inspect` is invoked on the array object referenced by local variable `b`, and its returned value `[1, 2, 3]`gets passed as an argument of the `puts` method invocation, outputting it to the console.

This code demonstrates the concept of variables as pointers.

## Question #19

What is the output of this code? why?

```ruby
def add_to_array(arr)
  arr = arr + [4]
end

original = [1, 2, 3]
add_to_array(original)
puts original.inspect
```

**Answer**

The output of this code is the array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`

On line 5, local variable `original`is initialized and references the array object with value `[1, 2, 3]`.

On line 6, method `add_to_array` is invoked and gets passed in the value references by `original`, which is bound to the method parameter `arr`.

On line 2, method local variable `arr` is reassigned to the returned value of the `#+` method invocation on the object referenced by `arr` which gets passed the array object with value `[4]`as an argument. The value referenced by `arr` is now a new array object with value `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. As this is the last line of the method, the value is returned implicitly.

On line 7, method `puts` is invoked and gets passed in the return value of the `inspect` method invocation on `original`, outputting `[1, 2, 3]`to the console. As there is a reassignment happening within the method, the original object is not mutated.

This code demonstrates the concept of object passing, in which Ruby behaves as pass-by-value.

These code snippets cover various aspects of variables as pointers, including:

•   Mutation of objects  
•   Method arguments and their effects on original objects  
•   Reassignment vs. mutation  
•   The behavior of different Ruby methods with respect to object references

Each snippet can be used as a question to test understanding of how Ruby handles object references and variable assignment.
