# Variable Scope

## Question # 1

What will the following code print and why?

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `7`. 

On line 1,  the local variable `a` is initialized and references the Integer Object `7`. 

On line 7, we invoke the `my_value` method with `a` as an argument. The value referenced by `a` is bound to the method parameter `b`.  Within the method, the method `+` is invoked on the object referenced by `b`, returning the value `17`, which is then reassigned to `b`. The value is implicitly returned by the method, but as it is not reassigned to any variable is then discarded.

On line 8, we invoke the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `7`.

This code snippet demonstrates object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as if "Pass-by-value" as the object passed into the method is immutable. It also demonstrates local variable scope within method definitions, in this code the method local variable `b` is available only within the method definition.
## Question # 2

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `7`. 

On line 1,  the local variable `a` is initialized and references the Integer Object `7`. 

On line 7, we invoke the `my_value` method with `a` as an argument. The value referenced by `a` is bound to the method parameter `a`.  Within the method, the method `+` is invoked on the object referenced by `a`, returning the value `17`, which is then reassigned to `a`. The value is implicitly returned by the method, but as it is not reassigned to any variable is then discarded.

On line 8, we invoke the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `7`.

This code snippet demonstrates object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as if "Pass-by-value" as the object passed into the method is immutable. It also demonstrates local variable scope within method definitions, in this code the method local variable `a` is a different variable from the one initialized in the outer scope.
## Question # 3

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `7`. 

On line 1,  the local variable `a` is initialized and references the Integer Object `7`. 

On lines 3-5, we define the method `my_value` with a parameter `b`.

On line 7, we invoke the method `my_value` with the expression `a + 5` as an argument, which evaluates to `12`. `12` is then bound to parameter `b`.

Within the method, on line 4, we initialize the method local variable `a` to `12`, and return it implicitly, but the value returned is discarded as it not assigned to any variable.

On line 8, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `7` as `a` refers to the local variable initialized on line 1.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of object passing, in which Ruby behaves as "pass-by-value" as the object passed into the method is immutable. It also demonstrates local variable scope within method definitions, as the method local variable `a` is a different variable than the one initialized in the outer scope on line 1. 


## Question # 4

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `Xy-zy`

The reason is that on line 7, we call the method `my_value` with `a` as an argument, which was initialized on line 1 and references the string object with value `Xyzzy`. The value is bound to the method parameter `b`. Within the method, the index assignment `b[2] = '-'` mutates the object referenced by both `b` and `a` by changing the element `z` located at index `2` by the string object with value `-`, resulting in the value `Xy-zy`, which is then returned implicitly.

On line 8, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `Xy-zy`.

The code snippet demonstrates object passing strategy, in which Ruby behaves as if "Pass-by-Reference" as the String object passed into the method is mutated by an index assignment method.

## Question # 5

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `Xyzzy`

The reason is that on line 7, when we call the `my_value` method with `a` as an argument, the String Object is bound to the method parameter `b` , which is then reassigned to a new string object `yzzyX` within the method's body.

When we call the method `puts` with `a` as an argument, the output is `Xyzzy` as it is the object referenced by local variable `a` initialized on line 1. The reassignment happening with the method's body on line 4, has no effect on the original object referenced by `a`.

This code snippet demonstrates object passing strategy in which Ruby behaves as if "Pass-by-value" as the argument is not mutated.


## Question # 6

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b = a + a
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

**Answer**

This code raises a `NameError` exception as the Ruby interpreter cannot find any variable `a` within the method's scope. The local variable `a`initialized in the outer scope is not available within the method's body.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope within method definitions.

## Question # 7

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

**Answer**

The code outputs `3`.

On line 1, the local variable `a` is initialized and references the integer object with value `7`.

On line 2, the local variable `array` is initialized and references an array object with the elements `[1, 2, 3]`.

On line 4, the `each` method is called on `array` and gets passed a `do..end` block as an argument. 

Within the block, the block parameter `element`is assigned to an element of `array`. Inside the block, the local variable `a` is reassigned to each value of `parameter`, starting with `1`, then `2`and finally `3`.

On line 8, we call the `puts` method with `a` as an argument, outputting `3`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of local variable scope within blocks after method invocation, in which variables initialized in the outer scope are available and can be modified within the block's scope.

## Question # 8

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```


## Question # 9

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a
```


## Question # 10

What will the following code print, and why?

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

def my_value(ary)
  ary.each do |b|
    a += b
  end
end

my_value(array)
puts a
```
