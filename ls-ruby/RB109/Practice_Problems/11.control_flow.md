# Control Flow

## Question #1

What will be the output of the following code?

```ruby
x = 5
if x > 3
  puts "Greater than 3"
elsif x < 3
  puts "Less than 3"
else
  puts "Equal to 3"
end
```


## Question #2

What is the value of `result` after this code runs?

```ruby
result = case
when false
  "It's false"
when nil
  "It's nil"
else
  "It's truthy"
end
```

The output and return value of this code snippet will be:

"It's truthy"

Here's why:
1.  The `case` statement doesn't have an explicit condition after it. In this situation, Ruby will evaluate each `when` condition and execute the first one that is truthy.
2.  The first `when` condition is `false`, which is not truthy, so it's skipped.
3.  The second `when` condition is `nil`, which is also not truthy, so it's skipped as well.
4.  Since none of the `when` conditions are truthy, the `else` clause is executed, which returns the string `"It's truthy"`.
5.  This string is assigned to the variable `result`.
6.  Finally, `p result` outputs and returns `"It's truthy"`.
This code demonstrates the concept of truthiness in Ruby. Remember, in Ruby, everything is considered truthy except `false` and `nil`. Since there's no explicit condition in the `case` statement, and none of the `when` conditions are true, the `else` clause is executed by default.
## Question #3

How many times will "Hello" be printed in this code?

```ruby
counter = 0
while counter < 5
  puts "Hello"
  counter += 1
end
```


## Question #4

What will be output by this code?

```ruby
['a', 'b', 'c'].each do |letter|
  break if letter == 'b'
  puts letter
end
```

## Question #5

What is the return value of this method?

```ruby
def check_number(num)
  if num > 0
    "Positive"
  elsif num < 0
    "Negative"
  else
    "Zero"
  end
end
```
