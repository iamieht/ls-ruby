# The Basics

## Literals

* **A literal** is any notation that lets you represent a fixed value in source code.
* These are all the literals in Ruby:

```ruby
'Hello, world!'          # string literal
375                      # integer literal
3.141528                 # float literal
true                     # boolean literal
{ 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 }   # hash literal
[ 1, 2, 3 ]              # array literal
:sym                     # symbol literal
nil                      # nil literal
```

## Strings

- **A String** is a list of characters in a specific sequence.
- String [**literals**](#Literals) are either single quotes `'hi'` or double quotes `"hi"` 
- To include single quotes within your string you can:
	- use double quotes
	- use single quotes with escaping. The backslash, or escape (`\`) character, tells the computer that the quotes that follow it are not meant as Ruby syntax but only as simple quote characters to be included in the string.

```ruby
# Ex. 1: with double quotes
"The man said, 'Hi there!'"

# Ex. 2: with single quotes and escaping
'The man said, \'Hi there!\''
```

- **String interpolation** allows you to merge Ruby code with strings. The returned expression will be concatenated with the string. Is allowed only with double quotes.

```ruby
a = 10
"my favorite number is #{a}"
```

- **Strings** are **mutable**
