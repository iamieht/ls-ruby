# Truthiness

* Truthiness differs from the boolean values `true` and `false` since Ruby considers several different values be "truthy", while only `true` is `true`.
* There are multiple values that Ruby treats as "falsy" (or "falsey"), but only `false` is `false`
* Ruby considers everything to be truthy other than the two falsy values, `false` and `nil`_.

This means that we can use any expression in a conditional, or with logical operators. As long as the expression isn't falsy, Ruby considers the value to be true. Note that an expression that Ruby _considers true_ is not the same as the `true` object, and something the Ruby _considers false_ is not the same as the `false` object. Truthiness concerns itself with the difference between values that Ruby considers true or false.

```ruby
num = 5

if num
  puts "valid number"
else
  puts "error!"
end

# valid number
```

If you run that code, it will actually output `"valid number"`. The reason is that Ruby considers any integer to be truthy.

## Expressions and Conditionals

In real code, you won't use the `true` or `false` objects directly in a conditional. Instead, you'll likely be evaluating some expression or method call in a conditional. Whatever the expression, it should evaluate to a `true` or `false` object.

```ruby
num = 5

if (num < 10)
  puts "small number"
else
  puts "large number"
end

# small number
```

The above outputs `"small number"` because the expression `num < 10` evaluates as true.

```ruby
puts "it's true!" if some_method_call
```

The above will output `"it's true!"` if `some_method_call` returns a truthy value.

When using method calls as a conditional expression in this way, you'll generally want the method to return a boolean rather than relying on the truthiness of a non-boolean return value.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators will return either a truthy or falsy value when evaluating two expressions.

* `&&`: this operator is the "and" operator and, in the following examples, will return `true` only if both expressions being evaluated are true.

```shell
irb:001> true && true
=> true
irb:002> true && false
=> false
irb:003> num = 5
=> 5
irb:004> num < 10 && num.odd?
=> true
irb:005> num > 10 && num.odd?
=> false
```

* `||` : this operator is the "or" operator and, in the following examples, will return `true` if either one of the evaluated objects is true. It's less strict than the `&&` operator.

```shell
irb:001> true || true
=> true
irb:002> false || false
=> false
irb:003> true || false
=> true
irb:004> false || true
=> true
```
* Short Circuiting: the `&&` and `||` operators exhibit a behavior called _short circuiting_, which means it will stop evaluating expressions once it can guarantee the return value.

```shell
irb:001> false && 3/0
=> false
```

The `&&` will short circuit when it encounters the first `false` expression. Notice the above code doesn't generate a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is because the `&&` operator didn't even evaluate the second expression; since the first expression is `false`, it can short circuit and return `false`.

```shell
irb:001> true || 3/0
=> true
```

The `||` will short circuit when it encounters the first `true` expression. The above code doesn't generate a `ZeroDivisionError` because `||` didn't evaluate the second expression; it short circuited after encountering `true`.
\
## Truthiness

* Be clear about the distinction between *truthy* values and the Boolean `true` and *falsy* values and the Boolean `false`.
* Every value apart from `false` and `nil` evaluates to `true` in a Boolean context.
* This is not the same as saying that *truthy* values equal to the Boolean value `true` and *falsy* values are equal to the Boolean `false`.

## Difference between boolean values and truthy/falsy values

- Boolean values are specifically the `true` and `false` objects. These are the only two boolean values in Ruby.
- Truthy and falsy values refer to how Ruby evaluates different values in a boolean context, like in an if statement.
- In Ruby, only `false` and `nil` are considered falsy. All other values are considered truthy, including:
	- true  
	- Any number (including 0)  
	- Any string (including empty strings)  
	- Arrays and hashes (even if empty)
- It's important to be precise and say a value "is truthy" or "evaluates to true" rather than saying it "is true", unless you're specifically referring to the boolean `true`.


## How truthiness affects conditional statements and logical operators (`&&` and `||`)?

In Ruby, truthiness affects conditional statements and logical operators (`&&` and `||`) in the following ways:

1. Conditional statements: 
	- Any value that is not `false` or `nil` is considered truthy in a conditional.
	- This means that even `0`, empty strings, and empty arrays are considered truthy.
  2. Logical AND (`&&`) operator: 
	    - Returns the first falsy operand if there is one.
	    - If all operands are truthy, it returns the last operand.
	    - Short-circuits: stops evaluating as soon as it encounters a falsy value.
3.  Logical OR (`||`) operator:  
	- Returns the first truthy operand if there is one.
	- If all operands are falsy, it returns the last operand.
	- Short-circuits: stops evaluating as soon as it encounters a truthy value.


## Short-Circuiting

Short-circuiting in Ruby is a behavior exhibited by the logical operators `&&` and `||`. When Ruby evaluates these operators, it stops as soon as it can determine the final result, without necessarily evaluating all parts of the expression.

For the `&&` (AND) operator:
- If the first operand is false, Ruby returns that value immediately without evaluating the second operand.  
- If the first operand is true, Ruby evaluates and returns the second operand.
 
For the `||` (OR) operator:
- If the first operand is true, Ruby returns that value immediately without evaluating the second operand.  
- If the first operand is false, Ruby evaluates and returns the second operand.

## How to use the `!!` operator?

In Ruby, you can use the `!!` operator to convert a value to its boolean equivalent like this:

```ruby
!!value
```

This double negation works as follows:
1.  The first `!` negates the value, converting it to `false` if it's truthy, or `true` if it's falsy.  
2.  The second `!` negates that result again, effectively converting the value to its boolean equivalent.

Examples:

```ruby
!!5 # => true 
!!0 # => true 
!!"" # => true 
!!nil # => false 
!!false # => false
```

This technique is useful when you need to explicitly convert a value to a boolean, ensuring you get either `true` or `false` as the result.

## how truthiness impacts method return values and their use in conditional statements?

In Ruby, truthiness impacts method return values and their use in conditional statements in the following ways:

1.  Any non-nil and non-false value returned by a method is considered truthy in a conditional statement.
2.  Methods that return nil or false will be considered falsy in conditional statements.
3.  This allows for concise conditional checks based on method return values. 

For example:

```ruby
def has_value?
      # some logic
      true  # or false, or nil
end

if has_value?
   puts "Has a value"
else
    puts "No value"
end
```

The conditional will execute based on the truthiness of the has_value? method's return value.

4.  It's common to use methods that return nil to indicate absence of a value:

```ruby
result = find_item(id)
if result
     puts "Item found: #{result}"
else
     puts "Item not found"
end
```

Here, if find_item returns nil (falsy), the else branch will execute.

5.  Methods can be chained in conditional statements, leveraging short-circuit evaluation:

```ruby
if object.valid? && object.save
      puts "Object saved successfully"
else
      puts "Object could not be saved"
end
```

This checks if the object is valid and only attempts to save it if it is.

Remember, in Ruby, only nil and false are considered falsy, while all other values (including 0, empty strings, and empty arrays) are truthy when used in conditional statements.
