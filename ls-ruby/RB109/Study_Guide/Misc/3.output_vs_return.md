# Output vs. Return

* `puts` method output something to the screen. It does not return what is output but `nil`. 
* Every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed.
* `return` keyword explicitly returns a value
* `p` method output the value of whatever is returned.

## Output vs. Return in Methods

- Every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed, unless an explicit return comes before it.
- `p` prints out the return value
- `puts` output values as strings with a carriage return
- `print` output values as strings without a carriage return

## List of methods with return values

| method or statement | return value         | outputted value                                        | Example      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `puts`              | `nil`                | evaluated expression as String with carriage return    | [[#`puts`]]  |
| `p`                 | evaluated expression | evaluated expression                                   | [[#`p`]]     |
| `print`             | `nil`                | evaluated expression as String without carriage return | [[#`print`]] |

### Examples

#### `puts`
```irb
puts "hello"
> hello
> nil
```

#### `p`

```irb
p "hello"
> "hello"
> "hello"
```

#### `print`
\
```irb
print "hello"
> hellonil
```


## Key Points

1. Return values:
	1. Every method in Ruby returns a value, even if not explicitly specified.
	2. The last evaluated expression in a method is automatically returned.
	3. You can use the `return` keyword to explicitly return a value earlier in a method.
2. Output:
	1. The `puts` method is commonly used to output text to the console.
	2. `puts` automatically adds a newline after the output.
	3. `puts` always returns `nil`, regardless of what it outputs.
3. Difference between return and output:
	1. Return values are used within your program logic, while output is for displaying information to the user.
	2. A method can both return a value and produce output, but it's generally better to separate these concerns.
4. Best practices:
	1. Methods should generally either return a meaningful value or have a side effect (like output), but not both.
	2. Name methods that output values with prefixes like `print_`, `say_`, or `display_` to make their purpose clear.
5. Checking return values:
	1. You can use `p` instead of `puts` to both output a value and see its return value.
	2. In IRB (Interactive Ruby), the return value of each expression is automatically displayed.

## Key Points on Block's return and output

1. Return values:
	1. The last evaluated expression in a block is implicitly returned.
	2. You can use the `return` keyword to explicitly return a value from a block, but this is uncommon.
2. Output:
	1. Blocks can contain `puts` or `print` statements to output information.
	2. Output from a block is separate from its return value.
3. Block return values and method behavior:
	1. Many Ruby methods that take blocks (like `each`, `map`, `select`) use the block's return value in different ways.
	2. For example, `map` creates a new array based on the block's return values, while `select` uses the truthiness of the block's return value to filter elements.
4. Accessing block return values:
	1. The method that yields to the block can capture and use the block's return value.
	2. For example, the `yield` keyword returns the value of the block.
5. Side effects vs return values:
	1. It's generally better for blocks to either have side effects (like printing) or return a value, but not both.
	2. This makes the block's purpose clearer and easier to understand.
