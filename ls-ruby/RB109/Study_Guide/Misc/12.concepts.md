# Concepts

In RB101, a "concept" refers to a fundamental programming principle or idea that you're learning and applying. These are the building blocks of programming that you'll use to solve problems and write code. Some key concepts in RB101 include:1.  Variables and data types  
2.  Control flow (if/else statements, loops)  
3.  Methods and return values  
4.  Arrays and hashes  
5.  Iteration and blocks  
6.  Variable scope  
7.  Mutability and immutability  
8.  Truthiness  
9.  Object passing (pass by reference vs. pass by value)Understanding these concepts means being able to recognize them in code, explain how they work, and use them effectively in your own programming. As you progress through RB101, you'll encounter these concepts repeatedly, each time gaining a deeper understanding of how they function and how to apply them in different situations.

there are indeed sub-concepts within the key concepts in RB101. Here are some important ones:
1.  Variables and Data Types:  
    •   Local variables  
    •   Constants  
    •   Type conversion
    2.  Control Flow:  
    •   Ternary operators  
    •   Case statements
    3.  Methods:  
    •   Method definition and invocation  
    •   Default parameters  
    •   Explicit and implicit return
    4.  Arrays and Hashes:  
    •   Array and hash methods  
    •   Nested collections
    5.  Iteration and Blocks:  
    •   Each, map, select methods  
    •   Block parameters
    6.  Variable Scope:  
    •   Method scope  
    •   Block scope  
    •   Shadowing
    7.  Mutability:  
    •   Destructive vs. non-destructive methods
    8.  Truthiness:  
    •   Falsey values (false and nil)  
    •   Short-circuit evaluation
    9.  Object Passing:  
    •   Object ids  
    •   Variable reassignment vs. mutation
