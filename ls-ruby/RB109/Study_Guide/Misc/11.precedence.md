# Precedence

Operator precedence in Ruby determines the order in which different operators are evaluated in an expression. Another way to think of precedence is that it controls the order of evaluation. It's safer to think of precedence as the mechanism used by Ruby to determine which operands get passed to each operator.

Here are some key points about precedence in Ruby:

1. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.
2. Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence order.
3. Multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) have higher precedence than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).
4. The order of evaluation for operators with the same precedence is typically left-to-right, with some exceptions.
5. Comparison operators like `==, !=, <, >, <=, >=` have lower precedence than arithmetic operators.
6. Logical operators `&&` and `||` have lower precedence than comparison operators.
7. The ternary operator (`?:`) has very low precedence.
8. An operator that has higher precedence than another is said to **bind** more tightly to its operands.
9. Method calls without parentheses can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior due to precedence rules.
10. It's generally a good practice to use parentheses when mixing different types of operators to make the intended order of operations clear.
11. Remember, when in doubt about the order of operations, it's best to use parentheses to explicitly define the intended evaluation order.

## Order of precedence from Higher to Lower

1. ( ) => Parenthesis
2. !, ~, unary +
3. **
4. unary -
5. *, /, %
6. +, -
7. <<, >>
8. &
9. |, ^
10. , >=, <, <=
11. <=>, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `=~`, `!~`
12. &&
13. ||
14. .., ...
15. ?, :
16. modifier-rescue
17. =, +=, -=, etc.
18. defined?
19. not
20. or, and
21. modifier-if, modifier-unless, modifier-while, modifier-until
22. { } blocks

## Meaning of an expression

The meaning of an expression in Ruby is determined by what is called **operator precedence**. It’s a set of [rules](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html) that dictate how Ruby determines what **operands** each operator takes. Operands are simply values -- the results of evaluating expressions -- that are used by the operator.
