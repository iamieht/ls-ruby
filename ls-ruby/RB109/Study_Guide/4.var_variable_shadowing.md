# Variable Shadowing

Is a Ruby mechanism that comes into play when we have a block that is passed to a method invocation with a parameter that has the same name as a local variable in the outer scope.

What variable shadowing does, is preventing access to the outer scope variable.

This is not something that you want to have happen, so use different variable names.

* Prevents access and modification to the outer scope local variable.
* Avoid variable shadowing.

### Example

```ruby
n = 10

[1, 2, 3].each do |n|
  puts n
end
```

The `puts n` will use the block parameter `n` and disregard the outer scoped local variable.

```ruby
n = 10

1.times do |n|
  n = 11
end

puts n          # => 10
```
