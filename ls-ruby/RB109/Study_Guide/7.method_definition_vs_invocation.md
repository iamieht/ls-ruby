# Method definition vs. Method invocation

**Method definition** is when we define a method using the `def` keyword

```ruby
def greeting
	puts "Hello"
end
```

**Method invocation** is when we call a method.

```ruby
greeting # 'Hello'
```

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
```

Any method can be called with a block, but the block is only executed if the method is defined in a particular way.

The block is part of the method invocation, as the block acts as an argument to the method. In the same way that a local variable can be passed as an argument to a method at invocation, when a method is called with a block, the block acts as an argument to that method.
