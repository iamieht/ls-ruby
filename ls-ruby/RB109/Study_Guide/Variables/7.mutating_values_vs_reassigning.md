# Mutating values vs. Reassigning Variables

## Variables and References

Objects are assigned to variables, like this:

```ruby
greeting = "Hello"
=> "Hello"
```

The `greeting` variable references the String object `'Hello'`. This reference occurs by storing the object id of the String in the variable.

If we assign `greeting` to another variable `whazzup`:

```shell
>> whazzup = greeting  
=> "Hello"
>> greeting  
=> "Hello"
>> whazzup  
=> "Hello"
>> greeting.object_id  
=> 70101471431160
>> whazzup.object_id  
=> 70101471431160
```

![[Pasted image 20240626104258.png]]
`greeting` and `whazzup` reference the same String object, both variables are aliases for each other.

If we mutate the String object, both variables will have the same value and the object id won't change.

```shell
>> greeting.upcase!  
=> "HELLO"
>> greeting  
=> "HELLO"
>> whazzup  
=> "HELLO"
>> whazzup.concat('!')  
=> "HELLO!"
>> greeting  
=> "HELLO!"
>> whazzup  
=> "HELLO!"
>> greeting.object_id  
=> 70101471431160
>> whazzup.object_id  
=> 70101471431160
```

## Reassignment

```shell
>> greeting = 'Dude!'  
=> "Dude!"
>> puts greeting  
=> "Dude!"
>> puts whazzup  
=> "HELLO!"
>> greeting.object_id  
=> 70101479528400
>> whazzup.object_id  
=> 70101471431160
```

Now both variables are referring to different objects.

Reassignment to a variable doesn't mutate the object referenced by the variable; instead, the variable is bound to a different object. 

## Mutability

Objects can be either mutable (their values can be altered) or immutable (cannot be altered, only reassigned).

### Immutable Objects

Numbers and Boolean values are immutable. Objects of some complex classes, such as `nil` (the only member of the NilClass class) and Range objects (e.g., `1..10`) are immutable. Any class can establish itself as immutable by simply not providing any methods that alter its state.

Here we have an example in which we reassign (not mutate) the variable `number` to the resulting value of the expression `2 * number`, which is a new integer value `6` . There are no methods available that let you mutate immutable objects, all one can do is reassign them.

```shell
>> number = 3  
=> 3
>> number  
=> 3
>> number = 2 * number  
=> 6
>> number  
=> 6
```

![[Pasted image 20240626105450.png]]
We can see that the object ids of both objects are different:

```shell
>> a = 5.2  
=> 5.2
>> b = 7.3  
=> 7.3
>> a  
=> 5.2
>> b  
=> 7.3
>> a.object_id  
=> 46837436124653162
>> b.object_id  
=> 65752554559609242
```

If we assign `b` to `a`:

```shell
>> a = b  
=> 7.3
>> a  
=> 7.3
>> b  
=> 7.3
>> a.object_id  
=> 65752554559609242
>> b.object_id  
=> 65752554559609242
```

If we try to alter the object:

```shell
>> b += 1.1  
=> 8.4
>> a  
=> 7.3
>> b  
=> 8.4
>> a.object_id  
=> 65752554559609242
>> b.object_id  
=> 32425917317067566
```

On the first line, we try to alter the object referenced by `b` by incrementing `b` by `1.1`. This yields `8.4` and, as we can see, `b` is also set to `8.4`. `a` has not been changed, and still references the `7.3` object. But, `b` now references a completely new object. Though we changed the value associated with `b`, we didn't mutate the object -- the object is immutable. Instead, `+=` created a brand-new `Float` object and bound `b` to the new object.

**Simple assignment never mutates an immutable object**

### Mutable Objects

Most objects in Ruby are mutable; they are objects of a class that permit changes to the object’s state in some way.

A setter method (or simply, a setter) is a method defined by a Ruby object that allows a programmer to explicitly change the value of part of an object.

In Arrays there are element setters `Array#[]=`

```shell
>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
>> a[3] = 0 # calls setter method  
>> a # => [1, 2, 3, 0, 5]
```

With Array objects you can use index assignment to alter what object is referenced by an element:

```shell
>> a = %w(a b c)  
=> ["a", "b", "c"]
>> a.object_id  
=> 70227178642840
>> a[1] = '-'    # calls `Array#[]=` setter method  
=> "-"
>> a  
=> ["a", "-", "c"]
>> a.object_id  
=> 70227178642840
```

We can mutate the array that `a` refers to and it doesn't create a new array since the object id remains the same.

![[Pasted image 20240626110429.png]]
`a` is a reference to an Array that contains 3 elements, each element is a reference to a String object. When we assign `-` to `a[1]` we are binding `a[1]` to a new String. We're mutating the array given by `a` by assigning a new string to the element at index `1` (`a[1]`).

Strings and other collections behave similar as Arrays, as the collection contains references to the actual objects in the collection.

Several Array methods, such as `#delete`, `#fill`, and `#insert` mutate the original object without creating a new one.

### Summary

Ruby variables are merely references to objects in memory; that is, a variable is merely a name for some object. Multiple variables can reference the same object, so mutating an object using a given variable name will be reflected in every other variable that is bound to that object. We’ve also learned that assignment to a variable merely changes the binding; the object the variable originally referenced is not mutated. Instead, a different object is bound to the variable.

We’ve also learned that certain object types, primarily numbers and Booleans but also some other types, are immutable in Ruby — unchanging; many other objects are mutable — changeable. If you attempt to change an immutable object, you won’t succeed — at best, you can create a new object, and bind a variable to that object with assignment. Mutable objects, however, can be mutated without creating new objects.

## Key Points

1. Reassignment:
	1. Creates a new object and points the variable to it.
	2. Does not change the original object.
	3. Non-mutating operation.
	4. Example: `a = 5` then `a = 10` (a now points to a new object with value 10)
2. Mutation:
	1. Modifies the existing object that the variable points to.
	2. Changes the object in place.
	3. Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3]` then `arr[1] = 4` (arr is still the same object, but its content has changed)
3. Object IDs:
	1. Reassignment results in a new object ID.
	2. Mutation keeps the same object ID.
4. Variable as pointers:
	1. Variables act as pointers to objects in memory.
	2. Reassignment changes what the variable points to.
	3. Mutation changes the object the variable points to.
5. Method behavior:
	1. Some methods mutate the caller (e.g., `Array#push`, `Array#<<`).
	2. Others return a new object (e.g., `Array#+`, `String#+`).
6.  Implications for multiple variables:
	1. When multiple variables point to the same object, mutation affects all variables.
	2. Reassignment only affects the reassigned variable.
7. Immutable vs. Mutable objects:
	1. Immutable objects (like integers) can't be mutated, only reassigned.
	2. Mutable objects (like arrays) can be both mutated and reassigned.
