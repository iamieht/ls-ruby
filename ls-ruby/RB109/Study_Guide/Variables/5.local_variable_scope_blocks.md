# Local variable scope in relation to blocks, including nested blocks and peer blocks

## Variable Scope and Blocks

* A block is a piece of code that follows a method invocation, delimited by either curly braces `{}` or `do/end`.

```ruby
total = 0
[1, 2, 3].each { |number| total += number }
puts total # => 6
```

```ruby
total = 0
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
	total += number
end
puts total # => 6
```

* The block following the method invocation is an argument being passed into the method.
* Ruby blocks create a new scope for local variables.
* The scope created by a block following a method invocation can be thought as *inner scope*
* A variable's scope is determined by where its initialized.
* block parameters are filled in when the method yields to the block
* **Inner scope can access and change variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa.** 

## Rule 1: outer scope variables can be accessed by inner scope

```ruby
a = 1         # outer scope variable

loop do       # the block following the invocation of the `loop` method creates an inner scope
  puts a      # => 1
  a = a + 1   # "a" is re-assigned to a new value
  break       # necessary to prevent infinite loop
end

puts a        # => 2  "a" was re-assigned in the inner scope
```

**Note**: 
	* The inner scope can access outer scope variables.
	* You can change variables from an inner scope and have that change affect the outer scope.

## Rule 2: inner scope variables cannot be accessed in outer scope

```ruby
loop do       # the block following the invocation of the `loop` method creates an inner scope
  b = 1
  break
end

puts b        # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `b' for main:Object
```

Here, `main` is the outer scope and does not have a `b` variable. Remember that where a variable is initialized determines its scope. In the above example, `b` is initialized in an inner scope.

## Rule 3: peer scopes do not conflict

```ruby
2.times do
  a = 'hi'
  puts a      # 'hi' <= this will be printed out twice due to the loop
end

loop do
  puts a      # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
  break
end

puts a        # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
```

The code `puts a` within the `loop do` and in `main` throws an error because `a` was initialized within the block code that follows the `times` method invocation. Peer blocks cannot reference variables initialized in other blocks. 

## Rule 4: Nested blocks

* Nested blocks will create nested scopes.
* They follow the same rules of inner and outer scoped variables. The usage of what's "outer" or "inner" is going to be relative.

```ruby
a = 1           # first level variable

loop do         # second level
  b = 2

  loop do       # third level
    c = 3
    puts a      # => 1
    puts b      # => 2
    puts c      # => 3
    break
  end

  puts a        # => 1
  puts b        # => 2
  puts c        # => NameError
  break
end

puts a          # => 1
puts b          # => NameError
puts c          # => NameError
```

## Rule 5: not all `do...end` pairs imply a block

* a `do...end` on a `for` or `while` loop is not a block


## Key Points

1. Blocks create a new scope for local variables.
2. Variables initialized outside a block are accessible within the block.
3. Variables initialized within a block are not accessible outside the block.
4. Nested blocks have access to variables in their outer blocks.
5. Peer blocks (blocks at the same level) do not share scope with each other.
6. Block parameters can shadow variables from the outer scope, preventing access to the outer variable within the block.
7. Modifying a variable from an outer scope within a block will affect the variable in the outer scope.
8. Each block creates its own scope, even when nested.
9. Method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables; blocks are not.
10. Variables initialized in an inner block are not accessible in an outer block.
