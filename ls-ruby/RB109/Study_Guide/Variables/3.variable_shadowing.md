# Variable Shadowing

Happens when a block parameter has the same name as a local variable initialized in the outer scope, preventing access and modification to the outer scope variable from within the block.

This is not something that you want to have happen, so use different variable names.

### Example

```ruby
n = 10

[1, 2, 3].each do |n|
  puts n
end
```

The `puts n` will use the block parameter `n` and disregard the outer scoped local variable.

```ruby
n = 10

1.times do |n|
  puts n #=> 0
  n = 11
  puts n #=> 11
end

puts n   # => 10
```
