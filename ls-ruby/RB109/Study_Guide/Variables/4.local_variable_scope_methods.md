# Local variable scope in relation to method definitions

## Variable Scope and Method Definitions

* Methods have self-contained scope. That means that only variables initialized within the method's body can be referenced or modified from within the method's body.
* These variables aren't available outside the method's body.
* Methods can only access variables that were initialized inside the method or that are defined as parameters.
* A method definition has no notion of "outer" or "inner" scope, you must explicitly pass in any parameters to a method definition.
* local variables that are not initialized inside a method definition must be defined as parameters.

### Rule 1: a method definition can't access local variables in another scope

```ruby
a = 'hi'

def some_method
	puts a
end

some_method #=> NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
```

### Rule 2: a method definition can access objects passed in

```ruby
def some_method(a)
	puts a
end

some_method(5) # => 5
```

The integer `5` is passed into `some_method` as an argument, assigned to the method parameter `a` and made available to the method body as a local variable.

```ruby
hello = 'hi'

def hello
	"Saying hello!"
end

puts hello
```

If the local variable and a method have the same name, Ruby first search for the local variable, if it is not found, then tries to find a method with the given name. If not found, a `NameError` message will be thrown. 

If we want to make sure the `hello` method is invoked, use `hello()`. There is no equivalent for explicitly referring to a local variable, the only solution would be to choose a different name for the variable and method.

```ruby
def amethod(param)
	param += " world"  # this is reassignment
	param + " world"   # this is concatenation. + is a method call. Is the same                           as param.+(" world)
	param << " world"  # this is mutation. Shovel operator is also a method call.
end

str = "hello"
amethod(str)

p str
```

```ruby
def amethod(param)
	param += " universe"
	param << " world"
end

str = "hello"
amethod(str)

p str # => "hello"
```

The line 2 `param += " universe"` returns a new string object, so the mutation on line 3 `param << " world"` does not affect the original str object but the new string object returned by line 2.


### Key Points

1.  Method definitions create their own scope. Local variables defined outside the method are not accessible within the method unless explicitly passed in as arguments.

2.  Local variables initialized within a method are not accessible outside of that method.

3.  Method parameters are scoped at the method level and behave like local variables within the method.

4.  Methods can access and modify constants, but it's generally not recommended to rely on this.

5.  Methods can return local variables, effectively making their values available outside the method scope.

6.  Variables defined within blocks (like `do...end` or `{}`) inside a method are scoped to that block.

```ruby
def example_method
  outer_variable = "I'm accessible throughout the method"

  [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
    block_variable = "I'm only accessible within this block"
    puts "Inside block: #{block_variable}"
    puts "Can also access: #{outer_variable}"
  end

  puts "Outside block: #{outer_variable}"
  puts "Can't access block_variable here"
  # Uncommenting the next line would raise an error:
  # puts block_variable
end

example_method
# Trying to access block_variable or outer_variable here would raise an error
```

In this example:
1.  `outer_variable` is defined within the method and is accessible throughout the entire method.  
2.  `block_variable` is defined within the `each` block and is only accessible within that block.  
3.  Both variables are accessible inside the block.  
4.  After the block, `outer_variable` is still accessible, but `block_variable` is not.  
5.  Neither variable is accessible outside the method.

7.  Method invocation with a block doesn't create a new scope for local variables. Variables initialized in the outer scope are accessible within the block.

```ruby
outer_variable = "I'm in the outer scope"

[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts "Inside the block: #{outer_variable}"
  inner_variable = "I'm defined inside the block"
end

puts "Outside the block: #{outer_variable}"

# Uncommenting the next line would raise an error:
# puts inner_variable
```

In this example:
1.  `outer_variable` is initialized in the outer scope.  
2.  The `each` method is called with a block.  
3.  Inside the block, we can access and use `outer_variable`.  
4.  We also define `inner_variable` inside the block.  
5.  After the block, we can still access `outer_variable`.  
6.  However, trying to access `inner_variable` outside the block would raise an error because it's not in scope.

This demonstrates that the block doesn't create a new scope for local variables, allowing us to access `outer_variable` inside the block. It also shows that variables initialized within the block (like `inner_variable`) are not accessible outside of it.
