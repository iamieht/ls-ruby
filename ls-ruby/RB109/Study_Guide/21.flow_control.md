# Flow Control

- **Conditional flow** in computer programming is when you want your data to do the right thing when it's supposed to. For that we use **conditionals**.

## Conditionals

- Are forks in the road. They tell the data where to go based on some defined parameters.
- Are formed using a combination of `if` statements and comparison and logical operators.
- Ruby has also a reserved word `unless` that acts as the opposite of `if`.

```ruby
# conditional.rb

puts "Put in a number"
a = gets.chomp.to_i

if a == 3
  puts "a is 3"
elsif a == 4
  puts "a is 4"
else
  puts "a is neither 3, nor 4"
end
```

### Valid Ruby conditionals

```ruby
# Example 1
if x == 3
  puts "x is 3"
end

# Example 2
if x == 3
  puts "x is 3"
elsif x == 4
  puts "x is 4"
end

# Example 3
if x == 3
  puts "x is 3"
else
  puts "x is NOT 3"
end

# Example 4: must use "then" keyword when using 1-line syntax
if x == 3 then puts "x is 3" end

# Example 5
puts "x is NOT 3" unless x == 3
```
## Comparisons

- They always return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- In comparisons, the expressions to the left and right of the operator are the operands.

### `==` "is equal to" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator is exactly equal to anything on the right.
- Strings, to be equal, must have the exact same value.
- Two values must have the same type or they are not equal.

### `!=` "not equal to" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator is not equal to anything to the right.
- If two values have different types, the return value is `true`.

### `<` "less than" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator has a lower value than anything to the right.

### `>` "greater than" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator has a higher value than anything to the right.
- When comparing strings, the comparison is character-by-character.
- Ruby moves from left-to-right in the strings looking for the first character that is different from its counterpart in the other string.
- Once it finds a character that differs, it compares that character with its counterpart, and makes a decision based on that.
- If both strings are equal up to the length of the shorter string, then the shorter string is considered less than the longer string.
- you can not use `<` or `<=` and `>` or `>=`  with values of different types.

```shell
# Example using 'less than' and 'greater than' 
irb :001 > 4 < 5 
=> true 
irb :002 > 4 > 5 
=> false 
irb :003 > "4" < "5" 
=> true 
irb :004 > "4" > "5" 
=> false 
irb :005 > "42" < "402" 
=> false 
irb :006 > "42" > "402" 
=> true 
irb :007 > "42" < "420" 
=> true 
irb :008 > "42" < 420 
ArgumentError (comparison of String with 420 failed) 
irb :009 > 42 > "420" 
ArgumentError (comparison of Integer with String failed)
```
### `<=` "less than or equal to" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator is less than or equal to anything to the right.

### `>=` "greater than or equal to" operator

- Anything to the left of the operator is greater than or equal to anything to the right.

## Combining Expressions

### Logical operators

- `&&` and `||` don't always return `true` or `false`, but they do when they operate on Boolean values.

#### `&&` "and" operator

- Expressions to the left and to the right of this operator have to be both true for the entire expression to be evaluated to true.

```ruby
irb :001 > (4 == 4) && (5 == 5) 
=> true 
irb :002 > (4 == 5) && (5 == 5) 
=> false 
irb :002 > (4 == 5) && (5 == 6) 
=> false
```

#### `||` "or" operator

- Either the expression to the left has to be true, or the expression to the right has to be true for the entire expression to be evaluated to true.

```ruby
irb :001 > (4 == 4) || (5 == 5) 
=> true 
irb :002 > (4 == 5) || (5 == 5) 
=> true 
irb :002 > (4 == 5) || (5 == 6) 
=> false
```

#### `!` "not" operator

- When you add this in front of a boolean expression it will change that boolean value to its opposite.

```ruby
irb :001 > !(4 == 4) 
=> false
```

### Order of precedence

- The following is a list of operations from highest order of precedence (top) to lowest (bottom):
	1. `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=` **Comparison**
	2. `==`, `!=` **Equality**
	3. `&&` - Logical AND
	4. `||` - Logical OR


## If Statement

* `if` expressions can return a value
* `if` statements use the reserved words: `if`, `elsif`, `else` and `end`.
* The result value of a `if` expression is the last value executed in the expression.

```ruby
result = if operator == '1'
          number1.to_i() + number2.to_i()
        elsif operator == '2'
          number1.to_i() - number2.to_i()
        elsif operator == '3'
          number1.to_i() * number2.to_i()
        elsif operator == '4'
          number1.to_f() / number2.to_f()
        end
```

## Ternary Operator (Ternary If)

- The **ternary operator** is a common Ruby idiom that makes a quick `if/else` statement easy and keeps it all on one line.

```ruby
irb :001 > true ? "this is true" : "this is not true" 
=> "this is true" 
irb :001 > false ? "this is true" : "this is not true" 
=> "this is not true"
```

- Ternary expressions should usually be used to select between 2 values, not to choose between two actions.
- The ternary expression's result should almost always be assigned to a variable, passed to a method as an argument, or returned by a method.

```ruby
foo = hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415    # Assign result of ?: to a variable
puts(hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415)    # Pass result as argument
return hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415    # Return result
```

## `unless` Expression

* Is the opposite of the `if` expression. If the value is `false`, the "then" expression is executed.
* The result value of an `unless` expression is the last value executed in the expression.

```ruby
unless true
	puts "the value is a false-value"
end
```

The above `unless` expression is the same as:

```ruby
if not true
	puts "the value is a false-value"
end
```

```ruby
unless true
	puts "the value is false"
else
	puts "the value is true"
end
```
## Case Statement

- Case statements use the reserved words `case`, `when`, `else`, and `end`.
- You can also save the result of a case statement into a variable.
- The result value of a `case` expression is the last value executed in the expression.
- 3 Examples:

```ruby
# Typical scenario

a = 5

case a
when 5
  puts "a is 5"
when 6
  puts "a is 6"
else
  puts "a is neither 5, nor 6"
end
```

```ruby
# save result into a variable

a = 5

answer = case a
  when 5
    "a is 5"
  when 6
    "a is 6"
  else
    "a is neither 5, nor 6"
  end

puts answer
```

```ruby
# case statement without argument

a = 5

case
when a == 5
  puts "a is 5"
when a == 6
  puts "a is 6"
else
  puts "a is neither 5, nor 6"
end
```

```ruby
# to place the body of the when on a single line

case a
when 1, 2 then puts "a is one or two"
when 3    then puts "a is three"
else           puts "I don't know what a is"
end
```
## True and False

-  **In Ruby, every expression evaluates as true when used in flow control, except for `false` and `nil`.**

```ruby
a = 5
if a
  puts "how can this be true?"
else
  puts "it is not true"
end
```

### Short-circuit evaluation

- The `&&` and `||` logical operators use short-circuit evaluation.
- These operators work with truthy and falsy values too, and they can also return truthy values instead of boolean values.
- When using `&&` and `||`, the return value is always the value of the operand evaluated last.

```ruby
irb :001 > 3 || 'foo' # last evaluated operand is 3 
=> 3 
irb :002 > 'foo' || 3 # last evaluated operand is 'foo' 
=> 'foo' 
irb :003 > nil || 'foo' # last evaluated operand is 'foo' 
=> 'foo' 
irb :004 > nil && 'foo' # last evaluated operand is nil 
=> nil 
irb :005 > 3 && 'foo' # last evaluated operand is 'foo' 
=> 'foo' 
irb :006 > 'foo' && 3 # last evaluated operand is 3 
=> 3
```

- When you want to convert a non-boolean value to a boolean you can use the `!!` operator (two consecutive `!` "not" operators)

```ruby
is_ok = !!(foo || bar)
```
- The expression `!!a` is equivalent to writing `!(!a)`. The inner `!` converts the value of `a` to `false` if it is truthy, or `true` if `a` is falsy. The outer `!` then flips `true` to `false` or `false` to `true`. In the end, we end up with a boolean value instead of a truthiness value
