# Methods

- What in most programming languages is called a procedure, it's called a Method in Ruby. 
- Allows you to extract common code to one place.
- It's define with the word `def` and ends with `end` 

```ruby
def say(parameter)
  # method body goes here
end
```
- A **parameter** is used to pass data from outside the method definition's scope in order to access it within the method definition.
- **Method invocation** is calling a method.
- **Arguments** are pieces of information that are passed to a method invocation to be modified or used to return a specific result.

## Mutating Arguments

Sometimes, when calling a method, one or more arguments can be altered permanently; that is, we are **mutating arguments**.

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]

# Example of a method definition that mutates its argument permanently
def mutate(array)
  array.pop
end

p "Before mutate method: #{a}"
mutate(a)
p "After mutate method: #{a}"
```

We have permanently modified the array that local variable `a` references by passing it to the `mutate` method, even though `a` is outside the method definition's scope. This is because the `pop` method mutates its calling object (the array specified by `array`). `a` is still pointing to the same array, but, in this case, the number of elements in the array has changed.

## Chaining Methods

- Because we know for certain that every method call returns something, we can chain methods together.

```ruby
"hi there".length.to_s      # returns "8" - a String
```

If anywhere along the chain, there's a `nil` return value or an exception is thrown, the entire chained call will break down.

## Method Calls as Arguments

- Ruby allows us to pass a method call as an argument to other methods.

```ruby
add(subtract(80, 10), multiply(subtract(20, 6), add(30, 5)))
=> 560
```

## The Call Stack

- The call stack helps Ruby keep track of what method is executing as well as where execution should resume when it returns.
- the call stack puts information about the current method on the top of the stack, then removes that information when the method returns.
- In Ruby, methods aren't the only thing that uses the call stack. Blocks, procs, and lambdas also use the call stack; in fact, they all use the same call stack as Ruby uses for methods.
- a **stack frame** -- that represents the global (top-level) portion of the program. The initial stack frame is sometimes called the `main` method. Ruby uses this frame to keep track of what part of the main program it is currently working on.
