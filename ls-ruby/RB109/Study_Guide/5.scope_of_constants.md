# Scope of Constants

Constants have *lexical scope*, so the scoping rules are not the same as local variables.

## Examples

### Rule 1: Constants can be accessed by methods

```ruby
USERNAME = 'Batman'

def authenticate
	puts "Logging in #{USERNAME}"
end

authenticate # => Logging in Batman
```

### Rule 2: Constants can be accessed by method invocation with a block

In this case it behaves exactly like a local variable.

```ruby
FAVORITE_COLOR = 'taupe'

1.times do
	puts "I love #{FAVORITE_COLOR}!" # => I love taupe!
end
```

### Rule 3: Constants initialized in an inner scope can be accessed in the outer scope

```ruby
loop do
	MY_TEAM = "Phoenix Suns"
	break
end

puts MY_TEAM # => Phoenix Suns
```
