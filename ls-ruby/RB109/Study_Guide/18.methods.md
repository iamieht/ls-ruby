# Methods

## `BasicObject`

### `object_id`

`object_id` -> `integer`
Returns an integer identifier for `obj`
* No two active objects will share an id.
* Note: that some objects of built-in classes are reused for optimization. This is the case for immediate values and frozen string literals.
* Immediate values are not passed by reference but are passed by value: `nil`, `true`, `false`, Fixnums, Symbols, and some Floats.

#### Example

```shell
Object.new.object_id  == Object.new.object_id  # => false
(21 * 2).object_id    == (21 * 2).object_id    # => true
"hello".object_id     == "hello".object_id     # => false
"hi".freeze.object_id == "hi".freeze.object_id # => true
```
