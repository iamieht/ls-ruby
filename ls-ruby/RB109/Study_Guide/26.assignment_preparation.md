# Assignment Preparation

## Precision of Language

* Say **method definition** or **method invocation / method call**
* Talk about **output, return value and mutations**
* A value is assigned to a variable
* Use **evaluates as true** or **is truthy** when discussing expressions that evaluate to `true` in a Boolean context
* Use **is true** or **is equal to true** only when talking about Boolean `true`
* Be concise
* Divide your answers in paragraphs
* Say `a` is initialized and the value `hello` is assigned to it
* Distinguish between method parameters and arguments: a method is defined with parameters but it is called with arguments.
