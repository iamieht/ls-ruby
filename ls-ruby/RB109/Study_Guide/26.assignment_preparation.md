# Assignment Preparation

## Precision of Language

* Say **method definition** or **method invocation / method call**
* Talk about **output, return value and mutations**
* A value is assigned to a variable
* Use **evaluates as true** or **is truthy** when discussing expressions that evaluate to `true` in a Boolean context
* Use **is true** or **is equal to true** only when talking about Boolean `true`
* Be concise
* Divide your answers in paragraphs
* Say `a` is initialized and the value `hello` is assigned to it
* Distinguish between method parameters and arguments: a method is defined with parameters but it is called with arguments.

## Vocabulary to keep in mind

```ruby
def foo(string)
	...
end
```

*We are defining a method called `foo` which takes 1 parameter named `string`*

```ruby
foo("hello")
```

*We are calling the method `foo` and pass the `String` `"hello"` as argument.*

```ruby
var = "hello"
```

*We are initializing a local variable `var` to the String `"hello"`*

```ruby
puts "hello"
```

*We are calling the `puts` method and pass it the `String` `"hello"` as an argument. This invocation will output `"hello"` and return `nil`*

```ruby
i = 10

loop do
	i -= 1
	break if i == 0
end
```

*We are initializing a local variable `i` to the `Integer` `10`.*
*We are calling the method `loop` and pass it a `do..end` block as an argument.*
*Inside the block, we are reassigning the local variable `i` to the return value of the `Integer#-` method called on the local variable `i` passed to it as an argument.*
*We break out of the loop with the keyword `break` if the value of the object that local variable `i` is referencing is equal to `0`.*

## Method definition vs. method invocation

A **method definition** is the place where we write out out method and what we want it to do.

```ruby
def my_example_method
	put "this is a cool method!"
end
```

A **method invocation or method call** is the place where we actually make use of this method.

```ruby
my_example_method # => "this is a cool method!" 
```

## Truthiness

* Be clear about the distinction between *truthy* values and the Boolean `true` and *falsy* values and the Boolean `false`.
* Every value apart from `false` and `nil` evaluates to `true` in a Boolean context.
* This is not the same as saying that *truthy* values equal to the Boolean value `true` and *falsy* values are equal to the Boolean `false`.

## Return values of method invocations and blocks

Ruby methods always return the evaluated result of the last expression in both blocks and method definitions unless and explicit return comes before it.

## Local variable scope

There are two major areas where we encounter local variable scoping rules:

* Method invocations with blocks (`do..end` or `{}`)
* Method definitions

### Local variable scope in method invocations with blocks

* **Blocks are actually arguments passed to method invocations**. We define blocks by passing them to a method invocation.
* Technically any method can be called with a block, but the block is only executed if the method is defined in a particular way.

**Method definition not using a a passed block**

```ruby
def greetings
	puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings do
	puts word
end

# Outputs 'Goodbye'
```

**Method definition using the passed block**

```ruby
def greetings
	yield
	puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings do
	puts word
end

# Outputs 'Hello'
# Outputs 'Goodbye'
```

Blocks also **create a new scope for local variables**. When we pass a block to a method invocation, we get the following:
	* An **inner scope** created inside of the block
	* An **outer scope** existing around and outside of the block

**A variable's scope is determined by where it is initialized**

When it comes to the combination of inner and outer scope, there are certain rules that come into play.

### Outer scope variables can be accessed by inner scope

```ruby
a = 1 # outer scope variable

loop do # the block following the invocation of the `loop` method creates an inner scope
	puts a # => 1
	a = a + 1 # "a" is re-assigned to a new value
	break # necessary to prevent infinite loop
end

puts a # => 2 "a" was re-assigned in the inner scope
```

### Inner scope variables cannot be accessed in outer scope

```ruby
loop do # the block following the invocation of the `loop` method creates an inner scope
	b = 1
	break
end

puts b # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `b' for main:Object
```

### Peer scopes do not conflict

```ruby
2.times do
	a = 'hi'
	puts a # 'hi' <= this will be printed out twice due to the loop
end

loop do
	puts a # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
	break
end

puts a # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
```

## Variable shadowing

Is a Ruby mechanism that comes into play when we have a block that is passed to a method invocation with a parameter that has the same name as a local variable in the outer scope.

```ruby
number = 10

[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
	number = 2
end
```

What variable shadowing does, is preventing access to the outer scope variable.

This is not something that you want to have happen, so use different variable names.

## Variables in method definitions

A block might have a leaky scope (being able to access and change the outer scope) but a **method's scope is entirely self-contained and separate**. The only way that a method definition can access **LOCAL** variables is by passing them as arguments or by initializing them inside its definition. There is not notion of outer/inner scope,

## Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference

There are two ways to handle objects that get passed to methods:

* Pass by Value
* Pass by Reference

### Pass by Value

Means that we provide the method with a copy of the object we pass to it. Whatever we do with that object inside of the method does not reflect on the outside object since we are altering its copy, not the object itself.

An example of a language that is purely pass by value would be C.

In some ways Ruby also shows "pass-by-value" behavior:

```ruby
def change_name(name)
	name = 'bob' # This reassignment does not change the object outside the method
end

name = 'jim'
change_name(name)
puts name # => jim
```

### Pass by Reference

Means that the method gets passed a reference to the original object, not a copy as is the case with pass by value. This also implies that everything we do with the object inside of the method directly alters the outside object as well.

In some ways Ruby also shows "pass by reference" behavior:

```ruby
def cap(str)
	str.capitalize!
end

name = "jim"
cap(name)
puts name # => Jim
```

### Call by sharing / Pass by value of the reference

Ruby exhibits behavior of both pass by value and pass by reference. Some people call this "call by sharing" or "pass by value of the reference". The ground rule that Ruby maintains is **when an operations within the method mutates the caller, it will affect the original object**.
