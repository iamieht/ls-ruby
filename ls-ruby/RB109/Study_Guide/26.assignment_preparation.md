# Assignment Preparation

## Precision of Language

* Say **method definition** or **method invocation / method call**
* Talk about **output, return value and mutations**
* A value is assigned to a variable
* Use **evaluates as true** or **is truthy** when discussing expressions that evaluate to `true` in a Boolean context
* Use **is true** or **is equal to true** only when talking about Boolean `true`
* Be concise
* Divide your answers in paragraphs
* Say `a` is initialized and the value `hello` is assigned to it
* Distinguish between method parameters and arguments: a method is defined with parameters but it is called with arguments.

## Vocabulary to keep in mind

```ruby
def foo(string)
	...
end
```

*We are defining a method called `foo` which takes 1 parameter named `string`*

```ruby
foo("hello")
```

*We are calling the method `foo` and pass the `String` `"hello"` as argument.*

```ruby
var = "hello"
```

*We are initializing a local variable `var` to the String `"hello"`*

```ruby
puts "hello"
```

*We are calling the `puts` method and pass it the `String` `"hello"` as an argument. This invocation will output `"hello"` and return `nil`*

```ruby
i = 10

loop do
	i -= 1
	break if i == 0
end
```

*We are initializing a local variable `i` to the `Integer` `10`.*
*We are calling the method `loop` and pass it a `do..end` block as an argument.*
*Inside the block, we are reassigning the local variable `i` to the return value of the `Integer#-` method called on the local variable `i` passed to it as an argument.*
*We break out of the loop with the keyword `break` if the value of the object that local variable `i` is referencing is equal to `0`.*

## Method definition vs. method invocation

A **method definition** is the place where we write out out method and what we want it to do.

```ruby
def my_example_method
	put "this is a cool method!"
end
```

A **method invocation or method call** is the place where we actually make use of this method.

```ruby
my_example_method # => "this is a cool method!" 
```

## Truthiness

* Be clear about the distinction between *truthy* values and the Boolean `true` and *falsy* values and the Boolean `false`.
* Every value apart from `false` and `nil` evaluates to `true` in a Boolean context.
* This is not the same as saying that *truthy* values equal to the Boolean value `true` and *falsy* values are equal to the Boolean `false`.

## Return values of method invocations and blocks

Ruby methods always return the evaluated result of the last expression in both blocks and method definitions unless and explicit return comes before it.
