# Mutable vs Immutable Data Types

* Immutable types in Ruby include numbers, booleans (true and false), nil, and symbols. Strings and arrays are mutable.
* For a data type to be immutable means that its value cannot be changed after it is created. Any operation on an immutable object returns a new object rather than modifying the original. Mutable types, on the other hand, can be modified in place after creation.
* Some mutable types in Ruby include arrays, hashes, and custom objects.
