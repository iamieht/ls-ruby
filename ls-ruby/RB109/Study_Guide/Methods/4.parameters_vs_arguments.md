# Parameters vs. Arguments

```ruby
def say(words) # => words is a parameter
	puts words
end
```

**Parameters** are used when you have data outside of a method definition's scope, but you need access to it within the method definition. If the method definition does not need access to any outside data, you do not need to define any parameters.

```ruby
say("Hello") # => "Hello is an argument"
```

**Arguments**Â are pieces of information that are sent to a method invocation to be modified or used to return a specific result. We "pass" arguments to a method when we call it.


## Key Points

1. Parameters are variables in a method definition that act as placeholders for values.
2. Arguments are the actual values passed to a method when it's called.
3. Parameters are defined inside the parentheses in a method definition:

```ruby
def greet(name)
    puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

4. Arguments are provided when calling the method:

```ruby
greet("Alice")
```

5. The number of arguments should match the number of parameters, unless default parameters are used.
6. Default parameters can be set in the method definition:

```ruby
def greet(name = "World")
    puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

7. Methods can have multiple parameters:

```ruby
def add(a, b)
    a + b
end
```

8. Arguments are passed to methods in the order they're defined in the parameters.
9. Ruby uses pass-by-value for immutable objects and pass-by-reference for mutable objects.
10. When a method mutates its arguments, it affects the original object outside the method.
