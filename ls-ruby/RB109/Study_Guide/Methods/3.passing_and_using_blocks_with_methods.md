# Passing and using blocks with methods

The way that an argument is used, whether it is a method parameter or a block, depends on how the method is defined.

## Case 1: method parameter not used

```ruby
def greetings(str)
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings(word)

# Outputs 'Goodbye' as `str` parameter is not used
```

## Case 2: method parameter used

```ruby
def greetings(str)
  puts str
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings(word)

# Outputs 'Hello'
# Outputs 'Goodbye'
```

## Case 3: block not executed

```ruby
def greetings
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings do
  puts word
end

# Outputs 'Goodbye'
```

The `greeting` method is invoked with a block, but the method is not defined to use a block in any way so the block is not executed.
## Case 4: block executed

```ruby
def greetings
  yield
  puts "Goodbye"
end

word = "Hello"

greetings do
  puts word
end

# Outputs 'Hello'
# Outputs 'Goodbye'
```

In this case, the `yield` keyword is what controls the interaction with the block, in this case it executes the block once. 

Blocks and methods can interact with each other; the level of interaction is set by the method definition and then used at method invocation.

When invoking a method with a block, we aren't just limited to executing code within the block; depending on the method definition, the method can use the _return value_ of the block to perform some other action.

```ruby
a = "hello"

[1, 2, 3].map { |num| a } # => ["hello", "hello", "hello"]
```

The `Array#map` method is defined in such a way that it uses the return value of the block to perform transformation on each element in an array. In the above example, the `#map` method doesn't have direct access to the `a` variable. However, the block that we pass to `map` (and that `map` calls) does have access to `a`. Thus, the block can use the value of `a` to determine the transformation value for each array element.

### Key Points

* Method definitions _cannot_ directly access local variables initialized outside of the method definition, nor can local variables initialized outside of the method definition be reassigned from within it.
* A block _can_ access local variables initialized outside of the block and can reassign those variables.
* methods can access local variables passed in as arguments
* methods can access local variables through interaction with blocks.
* we can think of **method definition** as setting a certain scope for any local variables in terms of the parameters that the method definition has, what it does with those parameters, and also how it interacts (if at all) with a block.
* We can then think of **method invocation** as using the scope set by the method definition. If the method is defined to use a block, then the scope of the block can provide additional flexibility in terms of how the method invocation interacts with its surroundings.
* The `def..end` construction in Ruby is method definition
* Referencing a method name, either of an existing method or subsequent to definition, is method invocation
* Method invocation followed by `{..}` or `do..end` defines a block; the block is _part of_ the method invocation
* Method definition _sets_ a scope for local variables in terms of parameters and interaction with blocks
* Method invocation _uses_ the scope set by the method definition
* Blocks are defined using either do...end or {...} syntax when calling a method  
* Blocks act as an argument to the method they're passed to  
* Methods can execute the block using the yield keyword  
* Blocks have access to variables in their surrounding scope  
* Blocks can take parameters, which are specified between | |  
* The return value of the block can be used by the method  
* Not all methods use the block that's passed to them - it depends on how the method is defined  
* Blocks create a new scope for local variables

For example:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num 
end
```

This passes a block to the each method, which yields to the block for each element in the array. The block parameter num takes on each value in turn.

### How the return value of the block can be used by a method?

```ruby
def multiply_by_two(array)
  array.map do |number|
    number * 2
  end
end

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = multiply_by_two(numbers)
puts result  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the `map` method is used within the `multiply_by_two` method. The block `{ |number| number * 2 }` is passed to `map`. For each element in the array, `map` yields to this block, which multiplies the number by 2. The return value of the block (the result of `number * 2`) is used by `map` to create a new array with these transformed values. The `map` method collects all these return values from the block and uses them to construct a new array, which becomes the return value of the `multiply_by_two` method. This demonstrates how the return value of a block (in this case, each doubled number) is used by a method (`map`) to produce a result.

## Blocks

Blocks in Ruby are an important concept in RB101. Here are the key things you need to know about blocks:1.  Blocks are chunks of code that can be passed to methods.2.  They are typically defined using do...end or curly braces {}.3.  Blocks can take parameters, which are specified between vertical bars |param1, param2|.4.  Methods can yield control to a block using the `yield` keyword.5.  Blocks have their own scope but can access variables from the outer scope.6.  Blocks are commonly used with iterators like `each`, `map`, and `select`.7.  They allow you to customize the behavior of methods without modifying the method itself.8.  Understanding block variable scope is important, especially how it relates to variables in the main program.9.  Blocks can affect variable reassignment in the outer scope, but not variable initialization.10. The return value of a block is the last evaluated expression within the block. Remember to practice using blocks with different Ruby methods to get comfortable with how they work and their various use cases.

### How parameters are used in a block?

Parameters in blocks are used to represent and work with elements from the collection or data structure that the block is iterating over. Here's how they work:1.  Parameters are defined between vertical bars `|param1, param2|` at the beginning of the block.2.  The number of parameters depends on the method being used. For example, `each` typically uses one parameter, while `each_with_index` uses two.3.  When the block is executed for each element, the parameters are assigned the corresponding values from the collection.4.  Inside the block, you can use these parameters to perform operations or checks on the current element.Here's an example:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number * 2
end
```

In this case, `number` is the parameter that represents each element of the array as the `each` method iterates through it.You can also have multiple parameters:

```ruby
{name: 'Alice', age: 30}.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key}: #{value}"
end
```

Here, `key` and `value` are parameters representing each key-value pair in the hash.Remember, the names of the parameters are arbitrary - you can choose any valid variable names that make sense for your code.

### Could you please explain how a block parameter `n` is used in this code snippet?

```ruby
def triangle(num)
  spaces = num - 1
  stars = 1

  num.times do |n|
    puts (' ' * spaces) + ('*' * stars)
    spaces -= 1
    stars += 1
  end
end
```

In this code snippet, the block parameter `n` is used as a counter in the `num.times` loop. Here's how it works:1.  The `times` method is called on `num`, which means the block will execute `num` times.2.  Each time the block runs, `n` represents the current iteration number, starting from 0 up to `num - 1`.3.  Although `n` is available inside the block, it's not actually used in this particular implementation. The code inside the block doesn't reference `n` at all.4.  Instead, the code uses the `spaces` and `stars` variables to control the number of spaces and asterisks printed in each line.5.  On each iteration, it prints a line with the current number of spaces followed by the current number of stars, then decreases `spaces` by 1 and increases `stars` by 1.So while `n` is available as a counter, this specific code doesn't make use of it. The triangle shape is created by manipulating the `spaces` and `stars` variables directly.

### How can I use block without a parameter in Ruby?

In Ruby, you can use a block without a parameter by simply omitting the parameter declaration between the vertical bars. Here's an example:

```ruby
3.times do
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
```

In this case, the block is executed three times, but it doesn't need any information about the current iteration, so no parameter is necessary.You can also use the curly brace syntax for single-line blocks without parameters:

```ruby
3.times { puts "Hello, world!" }
```

This approach is useful when you want to perform an action a certain number of times or iterate over a collection without needing to reference each element individually.

### When do I need to use a parameter being passed to the block?

You typically need to use a parameter being passed to a block when you want to work with or reference individual elements from the collection you're iterating over. Here are some common scenarios:1.  When you need to perform operations on each element:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  puts number * 2
end
```

2.  When you need to use the current element in a condition:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = numbers.select do |num|
  num.even?
end
```

3.  When you need to transform each element:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].map do |number|
  number * 3
end
```

4.  When you need to use both the element and its index:

```ruby
['a', 'b', 'c'].each_with_index do |letter, index|
  puts "#{index}: #{letter}"
end
```

If you don't need to use the individual elements within the block, you can omit the parameter:

```ruby
3.times do
  puts "Hello!"
end
```

Remember, the parameter name is arbitrary, but it should be descriptive of what it represents.
