# Output vs. Return

* `puts` method output something to the screen. It does not return what is output but `nil`. 
* Every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed.
* `return` keyword explicitly returns a value
* `p` method output the value of whatever is returned.

## Output vs. Return in Methods

- Every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed, unless an explicit return comes before it.
- `p` prints out the return value
- `puts` output values as strings with a carriage return
- `print` output values as strings without a carriage return
