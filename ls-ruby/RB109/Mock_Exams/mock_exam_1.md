# Mock Exam #1

## Question 1

What would you expect the code below to print out?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers
```


## Question #2

The result of the following statement will be an error:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
```

Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?


## Question #3

Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number:

```ruby
def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  begin
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end until divisor == 0
  factors
end
```

Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is `0`, or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you make this work without using the `begin`/`end until` construct? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

**Bonus 1**: What is the purpose of the `number % divisor == 0` ?
**Bonus 2:** What is the purpose of the second-to-last line (line 8) in the method (the `factors` before the method's `end`)?

## Question #4

Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. Elements are added to the rolling buffer and if the buffer becomes full, then new elements that are added will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations saying, "Take your pick. Do you like `<<` or `+` for modifying the buffer?". Is there a difference between the two, other than what operator she chose to use to concatenate an element to the buffer?

```ruby
def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end
```


## Question #5 

Alyssa asked Ben to write up a basic implementation of a Fibonacci calculator. A user passes in two numbers, and the calculator will keep computing the sequence until some limit is reached.

Ben coded up this implementation but complained that as soon as he ran it, he got an error. Something about the limit variable. What's wrong with the code?

```ruby
limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while first_num + second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"
```

How would you fix this so that it works?


## Question #6

What is the output of the following code? and what concept does it demonstrate?

```ruby
answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8
```


## Question #7

One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end
```

After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:

```ruby
mess_with_demographics(munsters)
```

Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

## Question #8

Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a method called `rps` as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors game: it returns the winning fist or, in the case of a tie, the fist that both players played.

```ruby
def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end
```

What is the result of the following call?

```ruby
puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")
```


## Question #9

Consider these two simple methods:

```ruby
def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
```

What would be the return value of the following method invocation?

```ruby
bar(foo)
```

## Question 10

Let's call a method, pass two strings as arguments and see how they can be treated differently depending on the method invoked on them inside the method definition.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

```ruby
def tricky_method(string_param_one, string_param_two)
  string_param_one += "rutabaga"
  string_param_two << "rutabaga"
end

string_arg_one = "pumpkins"
string_arg_two = "pumpkins"
tricky_method(string_arg_one, string_arg_two)

puts "String_arg_one looks like this now: #{string_arg_one}"
puts "String_arg_two looks like this now: #{string_arg_two}"
```


## Question #11

To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the user's version of it.

```ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```
