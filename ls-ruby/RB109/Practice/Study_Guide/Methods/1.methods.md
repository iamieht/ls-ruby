# Methods

- A method is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It's defined with a name and can accept parameters. When called, it executes its code and can return a value.
- It's define with the word `def` and ends with `end` 

```ruby
def say(parameter)
  # method body goes here
end
```
- A **parameter** is used to pass data from outside the method definition's scope in order to access it within the method definition.
- **Method invocation** is calling a method.
- **Arguments** are pieces of information that are passed to a method invocation to be modified or used to return a specific result.
- A **return value** is the value that a method outputs after it finishes executing. This is usually the last evaluated expression in the method, unless an explicit return statement is used.

## Mutating Arguments

Sometimes, when calling a method, one or more arguments can be altered permanently; that is, we are **mutating arguments**.

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]

# Example of a method definition that mutates its argument permanently
def mutate(array)
  array.pop
end

p "Before mutate method: #{a}"
mutate(a)
p "After mutate method: #{a}"
```

We have permanently modified the array that local variable `a` references by passing it to the `mutate` method, even though `a` is outside the method definition's scope. This is because the `pop` method mutates its calling object (the array specified by `array`). `a` is still pointing to the same array, but, in this case, the number of elements in the array has changed.

## Chaining Methods

- Because we know for certain that every method call returns something, we can chain methods together.

```ruby
"hi there".length.to_s      # returns "8" - a String
```

If anywhere along the chain, there's a `nil` return value or an exception is thrown, the entire chained call will break down.

## Method Calls as Arguments

- Ruby allows us to pass a method call as an argument to other methods.

```ruby
add(subtract(80, 10), multiply(subtract(20, 6), add(30, 5)))
=> 560
```

## The Call Stack

- The call stack helps Ruby keep track of what method is executing as well as where execution should resume when it returns.
- the call stack puts information about the current method on the top of the stack, then removes that information when the method returns.
- In Ruby, methods aren't the only thing that uses the call stack. Blocks, procs, and lambdas also use the call stack; in fact, they all use the same call stack as Ruby uses for methods.
- a **stack frame** -- that represents the global (top-level) portion of the program. The initial stack frame is sometimes called the `main` method. Ruby uses this frame to keep track of what part of the main program it is currently working on.

## Summary

* Methods are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the method name  
* Method names should use snake_case  
* Methods can take parameters, which act as local variables within the method  
* Methods implicitly return the last evaluated expression, but you can use the `return` keyword for explicit returns  
* Methods have their own scope - local variables inside a method are not accessible outside of it  
* Methods can be called with or without parentheses for the arguments  
* Methods should generally do one thing and have a clear purpose  
* Method names should reflect what they do, especially if they mutate arguments  
* It's good practice to keep methods short (around 10 lines or less)  
* Methods can be defined at the top level or within classes/modules
