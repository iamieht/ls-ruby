# Flow Control

## Ex1

Write a method that takes a string as an argument. The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, only if the string is longer than 10 characters.

```ruby
def all_caps10(string)
	string.size > 10 ? string.upcase : string
end

string = "hello world"
puts all_caps10(string)
```

**Code Explanation**

On line 5, variable `string` is initialized and references the string object with value `"hello world"` .

On line 6, the `all_caps10` method is invoked and gets passed the string value referenced by variable `string`.

From line 1 -3, the method `all_caps10` is defined. The string `"hello world"` is bound to the parameter `string`.

On line 2, a ternary operation is evaluated. The `size` method is invoked on the string value referenced by the method local variable `string`, returning the integer object with value `11` and then a comparison operation is evaluated with left operand being the integer `11` and right operand integer `10`. The return value of the comparison operation evaluates to `true` and then the expression `string.upcase` is evaluated. The method `upcase` is called on the string value referenced by the `string` variable, returning a new string object `"HELLO WORLD"`, which is then passed as an argument of the `puts` method invocation, outputting it to the console.

The return value is `nil`.
