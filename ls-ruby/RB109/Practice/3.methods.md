# Methods

## Ex1

Write a program that prints a greeting message. This program should contain a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter and returns a string.

```ruby
def greeting(name)
	"Hi! #{name}"
end

puts greeting("Ivan")
```

**Code Explanation**

On line 5, the `greeting` method is invoked and the string object with value `"Ivan"` is passed as an argument. 

From lines 1-3, the method `greeting` is defined. The string object value `"Ivan"` is bound to method parameter `name`. From within the method, the string object value referenced by method local variable `name` is interpolated into the string. As it is the last expression evaluated in the method, the string object value is returned and gets passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, outputting it to the console.

## Ex2

What do the following expressions evaluate to? That is, what value does each expression return?

```ruby
x = 2 # => 2
puts x = 2 # => nil
p name = "Joe" # => "Joe"
four = "four" # => "four"
print something = "nothing" # => nil
```

## Ex3

Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

```ruby
def multiply(num1, num2)
	num1 * num2
end
 
puts multiply(5, 8) #=> 40
```

**Code Explanation**

On line 5, the multiply method is invoked and gets passed the integer object values `5` and `8`.

From lines 1-3 the `multiply` method is defined. The integer object values `5` and `8` are bound to the method parameters `num1` and `num2`.

From withing the method, the `#*` method is called on the value referenced by method local variable `num1` and gets passed the value referenced by local variable `num2` as an argument. The expression evaluates as `40` and since is the last line of the method, this value is returned, which is then passed as an argument to the invocation of the `puts` method, outputting it into the console.
## Ex4

What will the following code print to the screen?

```ruby
def scream(words)
	words = words + "!!!!"
	return
	puts words
end

scream("Yippeee") #=> nothing is printed and the value nil is returned
```

**Code Explanation**

## Ex5

1) Edit the method definition in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen. 2) What does it return now?

```ruby
def scream(words)
	words = words + "!!!!"
	puts words
end

scream("Yippeee") #=> outputs Yippeee!!! and retuns nil
```
