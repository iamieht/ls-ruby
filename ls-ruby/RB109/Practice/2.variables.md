# Variables

## Ex1

Write a program that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

```ruby
puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp

puts "Hi! #{name}"
```

**Code Explanation**


## Ex2

Write a program that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years

```ruby
puts "How old are you?"
age = gets.chomp.to_i

time = 0

4.times do
	time += 10
	puts "In #{time} years you will be #{age + time}"
end
```

**Code Explanation**

## Ex3

Add another section onto ex1 that prints the name of the user 10 times.

```ruby
puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp

10.times { puts "Hi! #{name}" }
```

**Code Explanation**


## Ex4

Modify ex3 again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

```ruby
puts "What is your first name?"
first_name = gets.chomp

puts "What is your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp

puts "Hi! #{first_name} #{last_name}"
```
