# Arrays

## Ex1

Below we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array.

```ruby
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
number = 3

puts arr.include?(number)
```

**Code Explanation**

On line 1, a variable `arr` is initialized and references the array object `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`

On line 2, a variable `number` is initialized and references an integer object with value `3`

On line 5, the `include?` method is called on the array object referenced by the variable `arr` and gets passed the integer object value referenced by variable `number`. The method invocation returns the boolean value `true` as the integer `3` is an element in the array, which is then passed as an argument to the `puts` method invocation, outputting it to the console.
