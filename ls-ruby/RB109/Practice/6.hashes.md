# Hashes

## Ex1

Given a hash of family members, with keys as the title and an array of names as the values, use Ruby's built-in select method to gather only siblings' names into a new array.


```ruby

family = { uncles: ["bob", "joe", "steve"],
			sisters: ["jane", "jill", "beth"],
			brothers: ["frank","rob","david"],
			aunts: ["mary","sally","susan"]
}
 
siblings = family.select { |k, v| k == :sisters || k == :brothers }
arr = siblings.values.flatten

p arr
```
