# Variable Scope

## Definition

* Determines where in a program a variable is available for use.
* Is defined by where it is initialized or created.
* Is defined by a **method definition** or by a **block**.

## Variable Scope and Method Definitions

* Methods have self-contained scope:
	* Only variables initialized within the method's body can be referenced or modified from within the method's body.
	* These aren't available outside the method's body.

## Variable Scope and Blocks

* A block is a piece of code that follows a method's invocation, delimited by curly braces `{}` or `do/end`
* The piece of code can access and modify variables that are defined outside of the block.
* Any variable initialized inside the block can't be access by the outer scope.
* **Inner scope can access variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa.**
