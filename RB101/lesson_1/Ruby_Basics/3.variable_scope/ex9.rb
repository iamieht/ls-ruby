# What's My Value? (Part 9)
# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a

# 7
# This problem demonstrates shadowing. Shadowing occurs when a block parameter hides a local variable that is defined outside the block. Since the outer a is shadowed, the a += 1 has no effect on it. In fact, that statement has no effect at all.
