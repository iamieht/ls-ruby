# What's My Value? (Part 1)
# What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a

# 7. a refers to the local variable initialized in the outer scope.

# Reassignment, including assignment operators like +=, does not mutate a variable; instead, it binds the variable to a new object. That is, += sets the variable to point to a different object. Since line 4 binds b to a new object, the object pointed to by a remains unchanged. Thus, a is still equal to 7 at the time of the puts.

# Another way to look at this is that numbers in Ruby are immutable. Thus, there is no way for my_value to mutate the value referenced by b, which means that my_value does not (and can not) change the object referenced by a (7).
