# Return Value of break

## In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the return value to for the while loop.

`break` returns `nil` when no arguments are passed to `break`, or returns the value of the argument when an argument is provided. If more than 1 argument is passed to break, then, or course, an array is returned.
