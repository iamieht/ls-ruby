# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)
# What will the following code print? Why?

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal

# The output of the meal invocation is the string value 'Evening' as it is the last executed expression in the method.

# The last exercise explained how a method's return value is determined. Therefore, we can tell that the return value of meal will be "Evening" because it's the only line in the method.
