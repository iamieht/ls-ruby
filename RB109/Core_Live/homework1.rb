### Homework

# Write a method that accepts an alphabetical character and returns
# the 'value' of that character.

# The 'value' is relative to where the letter appears in the alphabet.
# 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, 'B' is 2, etc...
# For invalid inputs, return `nil`.


#### Bonus Question ####
# What assumptions did you have to make in order to write this function?
# - Only English alphabetical characters are valid, anything else is invalid (ex. Any other type rather than Strings)
# - Uppercase characters are supported as well
# - Only single characters are allowed
